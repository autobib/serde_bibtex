  abstract = {Coming up with new technologies on Internet, Semantic Web has brought
	new improvement spaces with new challenges to knowledge-based systems.
	In the application domain of Natural Language Processing, in particular
	text mining and information extraction, several analysis modules
	with different focus have been developed apriori, which can oer
	sentence-based analysis results. Our approach established a knowledge-based
	System architecture to integrate the results. The implemented Framework
	(named ParSemKB) is able to represent, store, reason and query the
	semantic information from corpus of unstructured textual documents.
	We selected proper language model for knowledge representation, namely
	OWL-DL, and we extended it with DL-Safe rules (SWRL) and other engineering
	ad-hoc by facing some diculties on \reication", negative information
	and uncertainty. The system is
	
	evaluated by several demonstrating test examples. We have chosen the
	best practice setting of tools, which provides a use-case of ecient
	answering of conjunctional query.},
