 Recent successes with incomplete satisfiability procedures raise numerous
 issues about their uses and evaluation.  Most such procedures search
 for "yes" answers, and give up if they do not find one.  The need for 
 "no" answers as well is addressed.  It is shown that a recent 
 approximation algorithm of Yannakakis can produce "no" answers only in 
 somewhat trivial cases.  The possibility of salvaging information from
 a "yes" program that is giving up, and using it to find a "no" answer
 is discussed.
 Two incomplete procedures were studied experimentally.
 One (based on "easy" resolutions) produces "no" answers.
 The other (based on Johnson's maximum satisfiability approximation
 algorithm) produces "yes" answers.  Both are deterministic, polynomial time
 algorithms, quadratic with careful implementation.  Combined, they
 solved 83\% of the formulas generated from a circuit-based applications,
 ranging from 400 to over 10000 variables.

 ANNOTE ="{Abstract: 
 A new algorithm for testing satisfiability of propositional formulas in 
 conjunctive normal form (CNF) is described.  It applies reasoning in the 
 form of certain resolution operations, and identification of equivalent 
 literals.  Resolution produces growth in the size of the formula, but within 
 a global quadratic bound; most previous methods avoid operations that 
 produce any growth, and generally do not identify equivalent literals.
 Computational experience so far suggests that the method does substantially
 less "guessing" than previously reported algorithms, while keeping a 
 polynomial time bound on the work done between guesses.  However, the
 time trade-off between reasoning and guessing is not yet clear.
 }",
 ANNOTE2="{
 We present experimental data comparing six branching strategies of the 
 proposed algorithm on a variety of problems, including several Dimacs
 benchmarks.  These branching strategies were shown to be different with 
 statistical significance and a new scheme based on Johnson's maximum 
 satisfiability approximation algorithm was the best on random 3-CNF formulas.
 In addition to the choice of a branching strategy, we found that 
 {\it variable reordering} can significantly impact the performance for many
 classes of problems in the Dimacs benchmark.  We have also tested both 
 satisfiable and unsatisfiable random 3-CNF formulas with 50-283 variables
 and 4.27 ratio of clauses to variables;  this class is generally acknowledged 
 to be relatively "hard" and required extensive backtracking by other 
 algorithms.  The new algorithm has solved them with surprisingly little 
 backtracking: for 200 variables at this ratio, the average number of guesses
 was 2,955 and the average CPU time was 119 seconds on SunSS10/41.  
 }",
 ANNOTE3="{
 For 283 variables, the average number of guesses was 57,503 with the
 values ranging from 105 to 182,006 in a set of 100 random formulas.
 We have also observed that unsatisfiable random problems do not follow the
 easy-hard-easy pattern.
 Our results indicate an exponential growth rate of
 $2^{.004L}$ for random formulas,
 where $L$ is the number of \emph{occurrences} of
 literals in the formula.
 Larger unsatisfiable formulas from circuit-fault analysis, with 500--10400
 variables were solved with \emph{no} backtracking in some cases.

 An algorithm for satisfiability testing in the propositional calculus
 with a worst case running time that grows at a rate less than
 $2^{(0.25+\epsilon)L}$ is described, where $L$ is the length of the 
 input expression.  This represents a new upper bound on the complexity
 of non-clausal satisfiability testing.  The performance is achieved by 
 using lemmas concerning assignment and pruning that preserve
 satisfiability, together with choosing a "good" variable upon which
 to recur. For expressions in CNF, it is shown that an upper 
 bound is $2^{0.128L}$.

    Feature Flow Fields are a well-accepted approach for extracting and
    tracking features.  In particular, they are often used to track
    critical points in time-dependent vector fields and to extract and
    track vortex core lines.  The general idea is to extract the
    feature or its temporal evolution using a stream line integration
    in a derived vector field - the so-called Feature Flow Field
    (FFF).  Hence, the desired feature line is a stream line of the
    FFF. As we will carefully analyze in this paper, the stream lines
    around this feature line may diverge from it.  This creates an
    unstable situation: if the integration moves slightly off the
    feature line due to numerical errors, then it will be captured by
    the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the real feature
    line.  The goal of this paper is to define a new FFF with the
    guarantee that the neighborhood of a feature line has always
    converging behavior.  This way, we have an automatic correction of
    numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the feature
    line, it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing
    integration.  This yields results which are an order of magnitude
    more accurate than the results from previous schemes.  We present
    new stable FFF formulations for the main applications of tracking
    critical points and solving the Parallel Vectors operator.  We
    apply our method to a number of data sets.
