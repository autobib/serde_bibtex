  organization = {Ministry of Defence},
  abstract = {Safety-related systems are being constructed from hardware, software
	and data. The data often describes the real world environment in
	which the system will operate and plays a vital role in ensuring
	its correct operation. Logic as well as good engineering practice
	dictates that data is produced to the same integrity requirements
	as the other system elements. Unfortunately, experience and anecdotal
	evidence suggest that this is all too commonly not the case.
	
	Data-driven systems use data from a number of sources including data
	extracted (and possibly processed) from existing external information
	systems and data produced specifically for the required system. This
	data is used to describe the system environment using configuration
	data (which is largely static or slowly moving) and status data (which
	is dynamic and will sometimes change rapidly). In addition, a minority
	of systems may use data to describe a changing use of the system
	with time. This additional data may be thought of as a schedule or
	timetable identifying control requirements as sequences or combinations
	of control actions.
	
	Typically, information is supplied to these systems through a ‘data
	supply chain’ that may involve transformations and adaptations by
	external information systems and human processes. The management
	of the data supply chain can introduce significant errors to the
	development and operation of safety-related systems. The work described
	in this paper sets out to provide much needed guidance on appropriate
	methods of dealing with data, which is a largely ignored system component.},

  abstract = {In the production of a computer-based safetyrelated system, it is
	common to partition the hardware and software elements into a system
	architecture. The software part of such an arrangement will generally
	include both the instructions that are executed by the processor(s),
	and the data that is used and produced by these instructions. In
	some cases, a large amount of static or configuration data forms
	an essential element within the system and plays a vital role in
	ensuring its correct operation. While data is subject to errors,
	experience shows that it is often not subjected to safety analysis
	techniques such as hazard and risk analysis. Data is often treated
	in a totally unstructured manner (often making error detection difficult)
	and very rarely is fault tolerance used to protect the system from
	data errors.
	
	To illustrate the role and importance of data in safety-related systems,
	this paper looks at the data associated with a railway command and
	control system. Such a system has a range of safety-related functions,

	and business planning systems. The paper considers typical data errors
	associated with the railway environment and proposes the early definition

  abstract = {Many safety critical systems use data to configure their functionality
	for a particular application. The approach to data preparation has
	traditionally been seen as an adjunct to the software development
	environment, and many industries have developed perceivably robust
	methods and techniques to ensure that the data meets necessary quality
	criteria.
	
	However, the increasing use of standardized components and subsystems
	has led to ever more dependence on configuration data to define a
	system’s functionality. The development of safety-related systems
	by integrating and adapting existing systems, rather than bespoke
	development, means that not only must the hardware and software engineering
	approach change, but also the strategies adopted for the management

	This paper describes work being undertaken as part of the development
	of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), a computer-based
	control and protection system for trains which is being introduced
	across Europe, to ensure that the data required by ERTMS is managed
	appropriately. This is of particular concern because ERTMS poses
	new challenges to managing the data, partly as a result of the integrity,
	accuracy and volume required, but also due to the growing dependence

	The approach we have adopted is to seek means of clearing a configuration

	This requires us to establish “safe” reconfigurations for the IMA
	system. Technically, we have formulated the search for a set of “equivalent”
	configurations as a multiobjective optimisation problem. Pragmatically,
	the search produces configuration tables which could be used by the

  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {Modern society depends on computers for a number of critical tasks
	in which failure can have very high costs. As a consequence, high
	levels of dependability (reliability, safety, etc.) are required
	from such computers, including their software. Whenever a quantitative
	approach to risk is adopted, these requirements must be stated in
	quantitative terms, and a rigorous demonstration of their being attained
	is necessary. For software used in the most critical roles, such
	demonstrations are not usually supplied. The fact is that the dependability
	requirements often lie near the limit of the current state of the
	art, or beyond, in terms not only of the ability to satisfy them,
	but also, and more often, of the ability to demonstrate that they
	are satisfied in the individual operational products (validation).
	We discuss reasons why such demonstrations cannot usually be provided
	with the means available: reliability growth models, testing with
	stable reliability, structural dependability modelling, as well as
	more informal arguments based on good engineering practice. We state
	some rigorous arguments about the limits of what can be validated
	with each of such means. Combining evidence from these different
	sources would seem to raise the levels that can be validated; yet
	this improvement is not such as to solve the problem. It appears
	that engineering practice must take into account the fact that no
	solution exists, at present, for the validation of ultra-high dependability

  school = {Department of Computer Science, University of York},

  month = {September},
  abstract = {Safety critical computing is a relatively young and rapidly developing
	technology, which nevertheless is being deployed in applications
	where a single accident may have extremely severe consequences. The
	safety record of critical systems presently in service is reasonably
	good, but increasing expectations of functionality and performance
	are challenging the capabilities of current design and assessment
	processes. One specific area where limitations of existing methods
	are becoming obvious is in the analysis techniques that are used
	to derive safety requirements and to provide evidence that they have
	been satisfied. There are significant practical problems in using
	existing analysis techniques to evaluate computer systems, but few
	viable new computerspecific methods have been developed.
	
	
	This thesis proposes and evaluates a set of principles for the design
	of effective techniques to address novel computer system safety analysis
	requirements. The principles are based on an appreciation of the
	technical concepts underlying successful existing system level analysis
	techniques, and of the practical qualities necessary to make a method
	industrially acceptable. The principles are applied in the development
	of two new safety analysis techniques for systems containing computers.
	
	
	The first new technique developed is Software Hazard Analysis and
	Resolution in Design (SHARD), a variant of the process industries’
	HAZOP technique. SHARD provides a structured approach to the identification
	of potentially hazardous behaviour in software systems. The second
	technique, Low-level Interaction Safety Analysis (LISA), implements
	a novel analysis approach based on a concept of system resources.
	It provides a method for establishing detailed evidence about the
	safety implications of interactions between software and the hardware
	upon which it is executed. The thesis describes the evaluation of
	the techniques through a series of large scale case studies and industrial
	trials.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are set to become part of every day
	air traffic operations perhaps within the next few years; however
	there are significant challenges that must be addressed in order
	to seamlessly introduce UAVs into non segregated airspace. This paper
	discusses some of the identified safety challenges in achieving this
	objective, taking a rigorous look at how one might argue the safety
	of UAV operations in non-segregated airspace from an Air Traffic
	Management (ATM) perspective. This paper draws upon the experience
	of the authors’ in the UAV domain and specifically the lessons learnt
	from the safety assessment work the authors undertook on behalf of
	EUROCONTROL DG/MIL on draft specifications for flying Military UAVs
	as Operational Air Traffic (OAT) outside segregated airspace.}

  abstract = {An increasing number of systems now use standardised hardware and
	software that is customised for a particular application using data.
	These data-driven systems offer flexibility and speed of implementation,
	but are dependent on the correctness of their data to ensure safe
	operation.
	
	Despite the obvious importance of the data within such systems, there
	is much evidence to suggest that this does not receive the same attention
	as other system elements. In many cases the data is developed quite
	separately from the remainder of the system, and may not benefit
	from the same level of hazard analysis, verification and validation.
	
	This paper considers the use of data in data-driven safety-related
	systems and suggests that in such systems it is appropriate to consider
	data as a distinct and separate component with its own development
	lifecycle. The paper then considers the architectural design of data-driven
	systems and the problems of validating such systems.},

	ofd configuration data. Where such systems are used in safety-related
	applications, the safety of the resulting system will often be dependent
	on the correctness of this data. It is therefore essential that configuration
	data is developed and tested to the same level of rigour as other
	system elements.
	
	Despite the obvious importance of data correctness in safety-related
	systems, anecdotal evidence suggests that data does not receive the
	same attention as other system elements. This view is reinforced
	by the observation that the standards in this area say almost nothing
	about the design, production, verification or maintenance of data.
	
	This paper describes a study to investigate the techniques being used
	to produce and manage data in a range of safety-related industries.
	This shows that data is indeed being largely ignored in many highly
	critical situations. The paper then goes on to suggest a way of tackling

	guidelines.},

  abstract = {This paper sets out to consider the approach which will be needed
	in order to demonstrate a safety argument for data. Whilst approaches
	for hardware and software are already well understood, no generally
	accepted approach for data could be found.
	
	
	Analysis of related documents and attempts to identify the aims which
	lay behind the development of a software standard led to the identification
	of a simple four stage process which could allow data to be processed
	in a timely manner, in order to demonstrate that safety properties
	have been achieved.
	
	
	No generally accepted approach to the second and third steps of the
	four-stage process could be identified. A notation has therefore
	been developed, to form the foundation of these steps. The notation
	brings together features of an existing tool for the definition of
	data structures, with features found in the specification language
	Z.
	
	
	A paper-based analysis of the proposed system has been carried out,
	which identifies those data errors which can be eliminated by this
	approach, and those which cannot. Proposals are presented for the
	further development of the system, in order to support the automated
	application of further safety requirements.},
