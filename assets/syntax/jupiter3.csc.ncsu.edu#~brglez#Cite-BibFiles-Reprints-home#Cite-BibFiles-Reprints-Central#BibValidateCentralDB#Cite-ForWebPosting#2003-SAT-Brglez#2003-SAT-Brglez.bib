abstract = "{
Analysis of our recent experiments for a group of SAT solvers and several 
classes of problem instances suggests a common mathematical framework with 
experiments in component reliability. In the latter, we observe the 
distribution of component  lifetime; in the former, we observe the 
distribution of execution time (runtime).
A lifetime distribution for 
hardware components is frequently found to have an exponential, Weibull, 
Pareto, or gamma distribution. Our experiments with state-of-the-art SAT 
solvers reveal normal distributions and exponential distributions of 
runtime and other related random variables, as well as other distributions 
commonly observed in reliability applications.

This paper describes an  experimental test bed for SAT solvers that emulates 
the reliability framework: equivalence classes of isomorphic problem instances 
(replicated hardware components), subjected to tests with specific SAT solvers 
(specifically controlled environments), observations of runtime, 
implications, etc. (lifetime), statistical analysis and modeling, based on 
the recorded random variables. The test bed not only facilitates 
systematic study and reliable improvement of any SAT solver but also 
supports the introduction and validation of new problem instance classes.
