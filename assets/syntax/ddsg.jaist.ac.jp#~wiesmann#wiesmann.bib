	Abstract = {One of the most important problems in fault-tolerant distributed computing is consensus. Unfortunately, consensus is not solvable in an asynchronous system with even a single crash failure. To solve this, one approach is to augment the system with a failure detector D, a distributed oracle that gives processes hints about which processes have crushed. Each process p has access to a local module D sub(p) which it can query to get hints about failures. In general, p will see only a subsequence of the outputs of D sub(p) due to the asynchronous nature of the system. If p suspects q at time t if at time t, the output of D sub(p) suggests that q is crashed. If, in addition, p sees this output as time t, then p doubts q at time t. }}

	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {This paper provides a realization of distributed leader election without having any eventual timely links. Progress is guaranteed in the following weak setting: Eventually one process can send messages such that every message obtains f timely responses, where f is a resilience bound. A crucial facet of this property is that the f responders need not be fixed, and may change from one message to another. In particular, this means that no specific link needs to remain timely. In the (common) case where f=1, this implies that the FLP impossibility result on consensus is circumvented if one process can at any time communicate in a timely manner with one other process in the system. The protocol also bears significant practical importance to well-known coordination schemes such as Paxos, because our setting more precisely captures the conditions on the elected leader for reaching timely consensus. Additionally, an extension of our protocol provides leader  stability, which guarantees against arbitrary demotion of a qualified leader and avoids performance penalties associated with leader changes in schemes such as Paxos.}}

	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {We study the degree of synchrony required to implement the leader election failure detector {$\Omega$} and to solve consensus in partially synchronous systems. We show that in a system with n processes and up to f process crashes, one can implement {$\Omega$} and solve consensus provided there exists some (unknown) correct process with f outgoing links that are eventually timely. In the special case where f = 1 , an important case in practice, this implies that to implement {$\Omega$} and solve consensus it is sufficient to have just one eventually timely link -- all the other links in the system, {\Theta}(n2) of them, may be asynchronous. There is no need to know which link p {\rightarrow} q is eventually timely, when it becomes timely, or what is its bound on message delay. Surprisingly, it is not even required that the source p or destination q of this link be correct: either p or q may actually crash, in which case the link p {\rightarrow} q is eventually timely in a trivial way, and it is useless for sending messages. We show that these results are in a sense optimal: even if every process has f - 1 eventually timely links, neither {$\Omega$} nor consensus can be solved. We also give an algorithm that implements {$\Omega$} in systems where some correct process has f outgoing links that are eventually timely, such that eventually only f links carry messages, and we show that this is optimal. For f = 1 , this algorithm ensures that all the links, except for one, eventually become quiescent.}}

	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {This paper considers the eventual leader election problem in asynchronous message-passing systems where an arbitrary number t of processes can crash (t  < n, where n is the total number of processes). It considers weak assumptions both on the initial knowledge of the processes and on the network behavior. More precisely, initially, a process knows only its identity and the fact that the process identities are different and totally ordered (it knows neither n nor t). Two eventual leader election protocols are presented. The first protocol assumes that a process also knows the lower bound on the number of processes that do not crash. This protocol requires the following behavioral properties from the underlying network: the graph made up of the correct processes and fair lossy links is strongly connected, and there is a correct process connected to t - f other correct processes (where f is the actual number of crashes in the considered run) through eventually timely paths (paths made up of correct processes and eventually timely links). This protocol is not communication-efficient in the sense that each correct process has to send messages forever. The second protocol is communication-efficient: after some time, only the final common leader has to send messages forever. This protocol does not require the processes to know, but requires stronger properties from the underlying network: each pair of correct processes has to be connected by fair lossy links (one in each direction), and there is a correct process whose output links to the rest of correct processes have to be eventually timely. This protocol enjoys also the property that each message is made up of several fields, each of which taking values from a finite domain.}}

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a performance comparison of database replication techniques based on total order broadcast. While the performance of total order broadcast-based replication techniques has been studied in previous papers, this paper presents many new contributions. First, it compares with each other techniques that were presented and evaluated separately, usually by comparing them to a classical replication scheme like distributed locking. Second, the evaluation is done using a finer network model than previous studies. Third, the paper compares techniques that offer the same consistency criterion (one-copy serializability) in the same environment using the same settings. The paper shows that, while networking performance has little influence in a LAN setting, the cost of synchronizing replicas is quite high. Because of this, total order broadcast-based techniques are very promising as they minimize synchronization between replicas.}}

	Year = {2005},
	Abstract = {Atomic broadcast in particular, and group communication in general, have mainly been specified and implemented in a system model where processes do not recover after a crash. The model is called crash-stop. The drawback of this model is its inability to express algorithms that tolerate the crash of a majority of processes. This has led to extend the crash-stop model to the so-called crash-recovery model, in which processes have access to stable storage, to log their state periodically. This allows them to recover a previous state after a crash.

However, the existing specifications of atomic broadcast in the crash-recovery model are not satisfactory, and the paper explains why. The paper also proposes a new speci fication of atomic broadcast in the crash-recovery model that addresses these issues. Specifically, our new specifi- cation allows to distinguish between a uniform and a nonuniform version of atomic broadcast. The non-uniform version logs less information, and is thus more efficient. The uniform and non-uniform atomic broadcast have been implemented and compared with a published atomic broadcast algorithm. Performance results are presented.}}

	Abstract = {MPI is one of the most adopted programming models for Large Clusters and Grid deployments. However, these systems often suffer from network or node failures. This raises the issue of selecting a fault tolerance approach for MPI. Automatic and transparent ones are based on either coordinated checkpointing or message logging associated with uncoordinated checkpoint. They are many protocols, implementations and optimizations for these approaches but few results about their comparison. Coordinated checkpoint has the advantage of a very low overhead on fault free executions. In contrary a message logging protocol systematically adds a significant message transfer penalty. The drawbacks of coordinated checkpoint come from its synchronization cost at checkpoint and restart times. In this paper we implement, evaluate and compare the two kinds of protocols with a special emphasis on their respective performance according to fault frequency. The main conclusion (under our experimental conditions) is that message logging becomes relevant for a large scale cluster from one fault every hour for applications with large dataset.}}

	Abstract = {Past research in message logging has focused on studying the relative overhead imposed by pessimistic, optimistic, and causal protocols during failure-free executions. In this paper, we give the first experimental evaluation of the performance of these protocols during recovery. Our results suggest that applications face a complex trade-off when choosing a message logging protocol for fault tolerance. On the one hand, optimistic protocols can provide fast failure-free execution and good performance during recovery, but are complex to implement and can create orphan processes. On the other hand, orphan-free protocols either risk being slow during recovery, e.g., sender-based pessimistic and causal protocols, or incur a substantial overhead during failure-free execution, e.g., receiver-based pessimistic protocols. To address this trade-off, we propose hybrid logging protocols, a new class of orphan-free protocols. We show that hybrid protocols perform within two percent of causal logging during failure-free execution and within two percent of receiver-based logging during recovery.}}

	Year = {1998},
	Abstract = {The Consensus problem is now well identified as being one of the most important problems encountered in the design and the construction of fault-tolerant distributed systems. This problem is defined as follows: processes have to reach a common decision, which depends on their inputs, despite failures. 
We consider the Consensus problem in asynchronous distributed systems augmented with unreliable failure detectors. Several protocols have been proposed for these systems, when process crashes are assumed to be definitive. This paper addresses the Consensus problem in a more practical asynchronous system model, namely in a context where processes can crash and recover. As a process crash entails the loss of its volatile memory, each process is equipped with a stable storage. So, to be efficient a Consensus protocol has to log as few critical data as possible. The proposed protocol uses a new class of failure detectors suited to
the crash/recovery model. It is particularly efficient when, whether there are crashes or not, the underlying failure detector makes few mistakes. Additionally, the proposed protocol tolerates message duplication and copes with some message losses.

We describe the already standardized interfaces that can be reused and introduce the interfaces that need to be added. SNMP is used extensively in the service: for messaging, process status description, configuration, services statistics and delivering failure detection information to applications.  We then present our implementation and an evaluation of performance and quality of service.

	Abstract = {We study the feasibility and cost of implementing {$\Omega$}---a fundamental failure detector at the core of many algorithms---in systems with weak reliability and synchrony assumptions. Intuitively, {$\Omega$} allows processes to eventually elect a common leader. We first give an algorithm that implements {$\Omega$} in a weak system S where processes are synchronous, but: (a) any number of them may crash, and (b) only the output links of an unknown correct process are eventually timely (all other links can be asynchronous and/or lossy). This is in contrast to previous implementations of {$\Omega$} which assume that a quadratic number of links are eventually timely, or systems that are strong enough to implement the eventually perfect failure detector P. We next show that implementing {$\Omega$} in S is expensive: even if we want an implementation that tolerates just one process crash, all correct processes (except possibly one) must send messages forever; moreover, a quadratic number of links must carry messages forever. We then show that with a small additional assumption---the existence of some unknown correct process whose asynchronous links are lossy but fair---we can implement {$\Omega$} efficiently: we give an algorithm for {$\Omega$} such that eventually only one process (the elected leader) sends messages.}}

Roughly speaking, a leader election algorithm is stable if it ensures that once a leader is elected, it remains the leader for as long as it does not crash and its links have been behaving well, irrespective of the behavior of other processes and links. In addition to being stable, our leader election algorithms have several desirable properties. In particular, they are all communication-efficient, i.e., they eventually use only n links to carry messages, and they are robust, i.e., they work in systems where only the links to/from some 
correct process are required to be eventually timely. Moreover, our best leader election algorithm tolerates message losses, and it ensures that a leader is elected in constant time when the system is stable. We conclude the paper by applying the above ideas to derive a robust and efficient algorithm for the eventually perfect failure detector {\diamond}P.

It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients. While sharing many of the same goals as previous distributed file systems, our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads and technological environment, both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some earlier file system assumptions. This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and explore radically different design points. The file system has successfully met our storage needs. It is widely deployed within Google as the storage platform for the generation and processing of data used by our service as well as research and development efforts that require large data sets. The largest cluster to date provides hundreds of terabytes of storage across thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In this paper, we present file system interface extensions designed to support distributed applications, discuss many aspects of our design, and report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and real world use. }}

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ 
To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. 
Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.}}

In the first part of the survey we classify rollback-recovery protocols into checkpoint-based and log-based. Checkpoint-based protocols rely solely on checkpointing for system state restoration. Checkpointing can be coordinated, uncoordinated, or communication-induced. Log-based protocols combine checkpointing with logging of nondeterministic events, encoded in tuples called determinants. Depending on how determinants are logged, log-based protocols can be pessimistic, optimistic, or causal. Throughout the survey, we highlight the research issues that are at the core of rollback-recovery and present the solutions that currently address them. We also compare the performance of different rollback-recovery protocols with respect to a series of desirable properties and discuss the issues that arise in the practical implementations of these protocols.}}

	Abstract = {In a distributed system using message logging and checkpointing to provide fault tolerance, there is 
always a unique maximum recoverable system state, regardless of the message logging protocol used. 
The proof of this relies on the observation that the set of system states that have occurred during any single 
execution of a system forms a lattice, with the sets of consistent and recoverable system states as sublattices. 
The maximum recoverable system state never decreases, and if all messages are eventually logged, the domino effect cannot occur. 
This paper presents a general model for reasoning about recovery in such a system and, based on this model, an efficient algorithm for determining the maximum recoverable system state at any time. This work unifies existing approaches to fault tolerance based on message logging and checkpointing, and improves on existing methods for optimistic recovery in distributed systems.

	Abstract = {Leader-based protocols rest on a primitive able to provide the processes with the same unique leader. Such protocols are very common in distributed computing to solve synchronization or coordination problems. Unfortunately, providing such a primitive is far from being trivial in asynchronous distributed systems prone to process crashes. (It is even impossible in fault-prone purely asynchronous systems.) To circumvent this difficulty, several protocols have been proposed that build a leader facility on top of an asynchronous distributed system enriched with synchrony assumptions. This paper consider another approach to build a leader facility, namely, it considers a behavioral property on the flow of messages that are exchanged. This property has the noteworthy feature not to involve timing assumptions. Two protocols based on this time-free property that implement a leader primitive are described. The first one uses potentially unbounded counters, while the second one (which is a little more involved) requires only finite memory. These protocols rely on simple design principles that make them attractive, easy to understand and provably correct.}}

Besides, now that a great number of available resources are becoming more widely distributed, it is more essential that they can be easily used with less manual configurations in Grid environments, where connectivity between different networks may be limited by firewalls and NATs.
In this paper, we present a scalable failure detection protocol which self-organizes even in Grid environments. Our failure detector autonomously creates dispersed monitoring relations among participating processes so that any process would be monitored by a small number of other processes, and quickly disseminates notification along the monitoring relations if failures are detected. With simulations and real experiments, we showed that our failure detector has high scalability, high reliability, and high efficiency practically.}}

	Abstract = {Failure detectors are an integral part of any fault tolerant distributed system and hence have been a well-studied area. However, earlier proposed failure detectors fail to perform efficiently when applied to Grid environments. Most of the earlier proposed detectors were either designed for local area networks or to handle small number of nodes and hence lack in areas such as scalability, efficiency, running times etc. In this paper we propose a highly scalable failure detector protocol that is aided by a membership management service. The membership management service is essential to make the failure detector transparent to changes in the system. Using a distributed heartbeat mechanism, for an unreliable failure detector, we have overcome the shortcomings of similar schemes proposed earlier. It realizes scalability by reducing context switching requirements and achieves faster failure detection . The membership management protocol handles membership issues with a worst case complexity of O(n) where n is the number of heartbeat groups. Note that n is much smaller than the total number of nodes in the Grid. The algorithm is also shown to be failure resilient and scalable.}}

Providing fault-tolerance for such dynamic environments is a challenging task. Considering such a context, this paper proposes an adaptive model for fault-tolerant distributed computing. This model encompasses both the synchronous model (where there are time bounds on processing speed and message delay) and the asynchronous model (where there is no time bound). To illustrate what can be done in this model and how to use it, the consensus problem is taken as a benchmark problem. An implementation of the model is also described. This implementation relies on a negotiated quality of service (QoS) for channels, that can be timely or untimely. Moreover, the QoS of a channel can be lost during the execution (i.e., dynamically modified from timely to untimely), thereby adding uncertainty into the system.}}

	Abstract = {Group communication provides communication primitives with various
semantics and their use greatly simplifies the development of highly
available services. However, despite tremendous advances in research
and numerous prototypes, group communication stays confined to small
niches and academic prototypes. In contrast, message-oriented
middleware such as the Java Message Service (JMS) is widely used, and
has become a de-facto standard. We believe that the lack of a
well-defined and easily understandable standard is the reason that
hinders the deployment of group communication systems.

Since JMS is a well-established technology, an interesting solution is
to extend JMS adding group communication primitives to it. Foremost,
this requires to extend the traditional semantics of group
communication in order to take into account various features of JMS,
e.g., durable/non-durable subscriptions and persistent/non-persistent
messages. The resulting new group communication specification,
together with the corresponding API, defines group communication
primitives compatible with JMS. As such, it facilitates the acceptance
of group communication by a larger community and provides a powerful
environment for building fault-tolerant applications.}}

We find that (1) operator error is the largest single cause of failures in two of the three services, (2) operator errors often take a long time to repair, (3) configuration errors are the largest category of operator errors, (4) failures in custom-written front-end software are significant, and (5) more extensive online testing and more thoroughly exposing and detecting component failures would reduce failure rates in at least one service. Qualitatively we find that improvement in the maintenance tools and systems used by service operations staff would decrease time to diagnose and repair problems.}}

	Abstract = {This paper studies the semantics of failure in distributed programming. We present a semantic model for distributed programs that use the standard sockets interface; it covers message loss, host failure and temporary disconnection, and supports reasoning about distributed infrastructure.We consider interaction via the UDP and ICMP protocols. To do this, it has been necessary to: 
* construct an experimentally-validated post-hoc specification of the UDP/ICMP sockets interface; 
* develop a timed operational semantics with threads, as such programs are typically multithreaded and depend on timeouts; * model the behaviour of partial systems, making explicit the interactions that the infrastructure offers to applications; 
* integrate the above with semantics for an executable fragment of a programming language (OCaml) with OS library primitives; and 
* use tool support to manage complexity, mechanizing the model with the HOL theorem prover. We illustrate the whole with a module providing na{\"\i}ve heartbeat failure detection.}}

	Abstract = {Since the first version of Chandra and Toueg's seminal paper titled ``Unreliable failure 
detectors for reliable distributed systems'' in 1991, the failure detector concept has been 
extensively studied and investigated. This is not at all surprising as failure detection is 
pervasive in the design, the analysis and the implementation of a lot of fault-tolerant 
distributed algorithms that constitute the core of distributed system middleware. 
The literature on this topic is mostly technical and appears mainly in theoretically 
inclined journals and conferences. The aim of this paper is to offer an introductory 
survey to the failure detector concept for readers who are not familiar with it and want 
to quickly understand its aim, its basic principles, its power and limitations. To attain 
this goal, the paper first describes the motivations that underlie the concept, and then 
surveys several distributed computing problems showing how they can be solved with 
the help of an appropriate failure detector. So, this short paper presents motivations, 
concepts, problems, definitions, and algorithms. It does not contain proofs. It is aimed 
at people who want to understand basics of failure detectors.

	Abstract = {Unreliable failure detectors introduced by Chandra and Toueg are abstract mechanisms that provide information about process crashes. On the one hand, failure detectors allow a statement of the minimal requirements on process failures that allow solutions to problems that cannot otherwise be solved in purely asynchronous systems. However, on the other hand, they cannot be implemented in such systems: their implementation requires that the underlying distributed system be enriched with additional assumptions. Classic failure detector implementations rely on additional synchrony assumptions such as partial synchrony. More recently, a new approach for implementing failure detectors has been proposed: it relies on behavioral properties on the flow of messages exchanged. This paper shows that these approaches are not antagonistic and can be advantageously combined. A hybrid protocol (the first to our knowledge) implementing failure detectors with eventual accuracy properties is presented. Interestingly, this protocol benefits from the best of both worlds in the sense that it converges (i.e., provides the required failure detector) as soon as either the system behaves synchronously or the required message exchange pattern is satisfied. This shows that, to expedite convergence, it can be interesting to consider that the underlying system can satisfy several alternative assumptions.}}

	Abstract = {Unreliable failure detectors introduced by Chandra and Toueg are abstract mechanisms that provide information on process failures. On the one hand, failure detectors allow to state the minimal requirements on process failures that allow to solve problems that cannot be solved in purely asynchronous systems. But, on the other hand, they cannot be implemented in such systems: their implementation requires that the underlying distributed system be enriched with additional assumptions. The usual failure detector implementations rely on additional synchrony assumptions (e.g., partial synchrony). This paper proposes a new look at the implementation of failure detectors and more specifically at Chandra-Toueg's failure detectors. The proposed approach does not rely on synchrony assumptions (e.g., it allows the communication delays to always increase). It is based on a query-response mechanism and assumes that the query/response messages exchanged obey a pattern where the responses from some processes to a query arrive among the (n - f) first ones (n being the total number of processes, f the maximum number of them that can crash, with 1  f < n). When we consider the particular case f = 1, and the implementation of a failure detector of the class denoted S (the weakest class that allows to solve the consensus problem), the additional assumption the underlying system has to satisfy boils down to a simple channel property, namely, there is eventually a pair of processes (pi, pj) such that the channel connecting them is never the slowest among the channels connecting pi or pj to the other processes. A probabilistic analysis shows that this requirement is practically met in asynchronous distributed systems.

Transient faults discrimination has long been performed in commercial systems: threshold-based techniques have been practiced for several years for this purpose. The present work aims to contribute to the usefulness of the count-and-threshold scheme, through the analysis of its behavior and the exploration of its effects on the system. To this goal, the scheme is mechanized as a device named a-count, endowed with a few controllable parameters. a-count tries to balance between two conflicting requirements: to keep in the system those components that have experienced just transient faults; and to remove quickly those affected by permanent or intermittent faults. Analytical models are derived, allowing detailed study of a-count's behaviour; the actual evaluation, in a range of configurations, is performed by standard tools, in terms of the delay in spotting faulty components and the probability of improperly blaming correct ones.}}

Using a group communication subsystem, it is shown how failure suspectors can be configured to model the requirements/semantics of cooperative applications thus avoiding ad-hoc system decisions. This approach is highly relevant in the context of large scale distributed systems like the Internet, where communication high variance and unpredictable delays increase the probability of incorrect failure detection. Applications are presented illustrating how failure suspectors are configured and possibly combined with new feedback techniques in order to implement more powerful cooperative environments.}}

Whenever a failure notification is triggered, all live members of the FUSE group will hear a notification within a bounded period of time, irrespective of node or communication failures. In contrast to previous work on failure detection, the responsibility for deciding that a failure has occurred is shared between the FUSE service and the distributed application. This allows applications to implement their own definitions of failure. Our experience building a scalable distributed event delivery system on an overlay network has convinced us of the usefulness of this service. Our results demonstrate that the network costs of each FUSE group can be small; in particular, our overlay network implementation requires no additional liveness-verifying ping traffic beyond that already needed to maintain the overlay, making the steady state network load independent of the number of active FUSE groups.}}

	Abstract = {An approach to cope with the impossibility of solving agreement problems in asynchronous systems made up of n processes and prone to t process crashes is to use failure detectors. An orthogonal approach that has been used is to consider conditions that restrict the possible inputs to such a problem. This paper considers a system with both failure detectors and conditions. The aim is to identify the failure detector class that abstracts away the synchrony needed to solve k-set agreement for a given condition.Three main contributions are presented. The first is a new class of failure detectors denoted ?ty, 0 y t. The processes can invoke a primitive queryy(S) with a set of process ids S. Roughly speaking, queryy(S) returns true only when all processes in S have crashed, provided t-y<|S| t. It is shown that the classic Chandra and Toueg's failure detectors are incomparable to the ?ty failure detectors. The second contribution is a generic condition-based protocol for ?ty that solves k-set agreement. It can be instantiated with any (t-d)-legal condition C and solves k-set agreement for k=1+max(0,d-y); termination is guaranteed for inputs in C. (A condition is x-legal if and only if it can be used to solve x-fault tolerant asynchronous consensus.) A variant of the protocol that terminates always is described. Finally, a corresponding lower bound is presented showing that there is no ?ty-based k-set agreement protocol for (t-d)-legal conditions with k max(0,d-y).}}

While a variety of techniques exist for detecting and correcting faults, the implementation of these techniques in a particular context can be difficult. Hence, we propose a fault detection service designed to be incorporated, in a modular fashion, into distributed computing systems, tools, or applications. This service uses wellknown techniques based on unreliable fault detectors to detect and report component failure, while allowing the user to trade off timeliness of reporting against false positive rates. We describe the architecture of this service, report on experimental results that quantify its cost and accuracy, and describe its use in two applications, monitoring the status of system components of the GUSTO computational grid testbed and as part of the NetSolve networkenabled numerical solver.}}

scheduling. Some tools are currently available and others are being developed for 
collecting and forwarding this data. The goal of this paper is to describe the major 
components of a Grid monitoring architecture and their essential interactions. By 
adopting standard terminology and describing the minimal specification to support 
required functionality, we hope to encourage the development of interoperable high- 
quality performance tools for the Grid.  To motivate the Grid Monitoring Architecture 
(GMA) design and to guide implementation, we also present the characteristics that are 
critical to proper functioning of a performance monitoring system for the Grid. }}

	Abstract = {Since the mid 1990s, network and systems management has steadily evolved from centralized paradigms, where the management application runs on asingle management station, to distributed paradigms,where it is distributed over many nodes. In this survey, our goal is to classify all these paradigms,especially the new ones, in order to help network andsystems administrators design a management application, and choose between mobile code, distributed objects, intelligent agents, etc. Step by step, we buildan enhanced taxonomy based on four criteria: the delegation granularity, the semantic richness of the information model, the degree of specificationof a task, and the degree of automation of management.}}

	Abstract = {Traditional centralized monitoring systems do not scale to present-day large, complex, network- computing systems. Based on recent SNMP stan- dards for distributed management, this paper ad- dresses the scalability problem through distribution of monitoring tasks, applicable for tools such as SIMONE (SNMP-based monitoring prototype implemented by the authors). Distribution is achieved by introducing one or more levels of a dual entity called the Intermediate Level Manager (ILM) between a manager and the agents. The ILM accepts monitoring tasks described in the form of scripts and delegated by the next higher en- tity. The solution is exible and integratable into a SNMP tool without altering other system compo- nents. A testbed of up to 1024 monitoring elements is used to assess scalability. Noticeable improvements in the round trip delay (from seconds to less than tenth of a second) were observed when more than 200 monitor- ing elements are present and as few as 2 ILM's are used.}}

	Abstract = {Traditional centralized network management solutions do not scale to present-day large-scale computer/communication networks. Decentralization/distributed solutions can solve some of these problems (Goldszmidt, G. and Yemini, Y., 1995), and thus there is considerable interest in distributed/decentralized network management applications. We present the design and evaluation of an SNMP-based distributed network fault detection/monitoring system. We integrate into the SNMP framework our ML-ADSD algorithm (Su, M.-S. et al., Proc. 39th Annual Allerton Conf. on Commun., Control, and Computers, 2001; Su, Multilevel distributed diagnosis and the design of a distributed network fault detection system based on the SNMP protocol, Ph.D. Thesis, School of Computer Science, University of Oklahoma, 2002) for fault diagnosis in a distributed processor system. The algorithm uses the multilevel paradigm and requires only minor modifications to be scalable to networks of varying sizes. The system is fault tolerant, allowing processor failure and/or recovery during the diagnosis process. We have implemented the system on an Ethernet network of 32 machines. Our results show that the diagnosis latency (or time to termination) is much better than that of earlier solutions. Also, the system's bandwidth utilization is insignificant, demonstrating the practicality of its deployment in a real network. We have successfully integrated three modern disciplines: network management, distributed computing and system level diagnosis.}}

	Abstract = {According to the spread of Internet, various Failures become serious problems.  It is considered that 
Failures are difficult to find for the following reasons.  One is that the Internet communication includes 
multiple server accesses with individual protocols, and failures may occur in any of them.  Another is that 
the Internet consists of multiple networks, such as a LAN within a company and an Internet service 
provider network, and a failure occurred in one network is difficult to find by the outside networks.  We are 
proposing a failure detection procedure by retrying a communication on which a user reported any 
problems.  The purpose of our approach is to detect various Failures, such as failures caused by congestion 
and those caused by protocol procedures as well as a hardware failure.  In this paper, we present the 
overview and the details of our approach.   }}

This paper describes adaptive monitoring (AM), which detects failure rapidly with only a slight addition in network load, and Monitoring Information Notification Protocol (MINP), which transfer failure information efficiently. Experiments on a testbed hosting real Web Services confirm that our system can detect failure and switch to a service alternative within the recovery time demanded by most applications. We also confirm that the proposed method is effective in reducing network load as well as satisfying application requirements.}}

To preserve fault-tolerance during the life time of the system, for each process which has crashed, a new replica must be kept under surveillance to detect process or node crashes as soon as possible. In this paper we describe two solutions for the surveillance problem. Both approaches are based on an election algorithm which has to cope with process and communication failures. The election algorithm is presented in detail. }}

	Abstract = {The concept of unreliable failure detector was introduced by Chandra and Toueg as a mechanism that provides in-formation about process failures. Depending on the properties the failure detector guarantee, they proposed taxonomy of failure detectors. It has been shown that one of the classes of this taxonomy, namely eventually Strong (3 S), is the weakest class allowing solving the Consensus problem.In this paper, we present a new algorithm implementing 3 S. Our algorithm guarantees that eventually all the correct processes agree on a common correct process. This property trivially allows us to provide the accuracy and completeness properties required by 3 S. We show, then, that our algorithm is better than any other proposed implementation of 3 S in terms of the number of messages and the total amount of information periodically sent. In particular, previous algorithms require to periodically exchanging at least a quadratic amount of information, while ours only requires O(n log n) (where n is the number of processes).However, we also propose a new measure to evaluate the efficiency of this kind of algorithms, the eventual monitoring degree, which does not rely on a periodic behavior and expresses better the degree of processing required by the algorithms. We show that the runs of our algorithm have optimal eventual monitoring degree}}

Failure detectors are a popular middleware mechanismused for improving the dependability of distributed systems and applications. Their QoS greatly influences the QoS that upper layers may provide. It is thus of uttermost importance to equip a system with an appropriate failure detector and to properly tune its parameters for the most desirable QoS to be provided. The paper first analyzes the QoS indicators and the structure of push-style failure detectors and then introduces the choices for estimators and safety margins used to build several (30) failure detectors. The experimental setup designed and implemented to allow a fair comparison of QoS of the several alternatives in a real representative experimental setting is then described. Finally the results obtained through the experiments and their interpretation are provided.}}

We provide a protocol that solves the Consensus problem in this model whenever a majority of the processes become connected, regardless of past omissions. Moreover, in our protocol it is not necessary to save and repeatedly send all past messages, which makes it more efficient than previous protocols in this model.}}

Its first specificity of our implementation lies in the fact that it is designed as a shared service among several applications by way of an adaptation layer between the failure detector and 
the application. This layer adapts the quality of service according to application needs. The second specificity is the hierarchic organization of the detection service: it allows to decrease the number of message and the processor load. 
Through an experimentation evaluation, we show that our implementation is adaptable to the environment characteristics and usable with large scale applications.

	Abstract = {This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performing remote ping, traceroute and lookup operations at a remote host.  When managing a network it is useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or traceroute operations when performed at a remote host.  A Lookup capability is defined in order to enable resolving of either an IP address to an DNS name or an DNS name to an IP address at a remote host.

Currently, there are several enterprise-specific MIBs for performing remote ping or traceroute operations.  The purpose of this memo is to define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability.}}

	Abstract = {Anubis is a simple state monitoring service that supports coordinated action among distributed management agents. It uses a temporal consistency model that addresses symmetric and asymmetric network partitions. We have used Anubis to support distributed management of adaptive applications in Grid and Utility computing environments and our experience has shown that the abstraction and properties provided by the service simplify the task of programming distributed management behavior. We support this claim by examining three common use cases that our developers encountered, namely: resource management, lifecycle coordination, and compositional failure management.}}

	Abstract = {This paper presents a design principle that helps guide placement of functions among the modules of a distributed computer system. The principle, called the end-to-end argument, suggests that functions placed at low levels of a system may be redundant or of little value when compared with the cost of providing them at that low level. Examples discussed in the paper include bit-error recovery, security using encryption, duplicate message suppression, recovery from system crashes, and delivery acknowledgment. Low-level mechanisms to support these functions are justified only as performance enhance- 
ments.

	Abstract = {Semantic Reliability is a novel correctness criterion for multicast protocols based on the concept of message obsolescence: A message becomes obsolete when its content or purpose is superseded by a subsequent message. By exploiting obsolescence, a reliable multicast protocol may drop irrelevant messages to find additional buffer space for new messages. This makes the multicast protocol more resilient to transient performance perturbations of group members, thus improving throughput stability. This paper describes our experience in developing a suite of semantically reliable protocols. It summarizes the motivation, definition, and algorithmic issues and presents performance figures obtained with a running implementation. The data obtained experimentally is compared with analytic and simulation models. This comparison allows us to confirm the validity of these models and the usefulness of the approach. Finally, the paper reports the application of our prototype to distributed multiplayer games.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of broadcasting messages in a reliable manner, within a practical asynchronous system where processes and channels may crash and recover. In this crash-recovery model, we present meaningful specifications of reliable broadcast and we describe algorithms that implement those specifications. Our approach is modular and incremental. It is modular in the sense that we give the properties of reliable broadcast separately and then consider their composition. It is incremental in the sense that we show how to automatically transform any reliable broadcast algorithm that implements a given specification into one that implements a stronger specification. In particular, we show how to reuse, in a crash-recovery model, reliable broadcast algorithms that were initially designed in a simpler crash-stop model.}}

We exhibit here a probabilistic solution for this problem, which guarantees that as long as a majority of the processes continues to operate, a decision will be made (Theorem 1). Our solution is completely asynchronous and is rather strong: As in [4], it is guaranteed to work with probability 1 even against an adversary scheduler who knows all about the system.}}

This extension leads us to distinguish between time-triggered suspicions of processes and space-triggered exclusions}}

In this paper, we identify four major limitations to CATOCS, investigate the applicability of CATOCS to several classes of distributed applications in light of these limitations, and the potential impact of these facilities on communication scalability and robustness. From this investigation, we find limited merit and several potential problems in using CATOCS. The fundamental difficulty with the CATOCS is that it attempts to solve problems at the communication level in violation of the well-known end-to-end argument.}}

We characterise unreliable failure detectors in terms of two properties---completeness and accuracy. We show that Consensus can be solved even with unreliable failure detectors that make an infinite number of mistakes, and determine which ones can be used to solve Consensus despite any number of crashes, and which ones require a majority of correct processes. We prove that Consensus and Atomic Broadcast are reducible to each other in asynchronous systems with crash failures; thus, the above results also apply to Atomic Broadcast. A companion paper shows that one of the failure detectors introduced here is the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus [Chandra et al. 1992].}}

	Year = {1998},
	Abstract = {This paper presents the semi-passive replication technique, a variant of passive replication, that can be implemented in the asynchronous system model without requiring a membership service to agree on a primary. Passive replication is a popular replication technique since it can tolerate non-deterministic servers (e.g., multi-threaded servers) and uses little processing power when compared to other replication techniques. However, passive replication suffers from a high reconfiguration cost in case of the failure of the primary. The semi-passive replication technique presented in the paper benefits from the same advantages as passive replication. However, since it does not require a group membership service, semi-passive replication has a considerably lower cost in case of failure. As explained in the paper, this technique can benefit from an aggressive time-out value significantly lower than what a group membership allows. As a result, the reaction to crashes is greatly improved. The semi-passive replication algorithm uses failure detectors. The algorithm given in the paper is analysed in the failure free case and in the case of one server crash. The response time (for the client) of these two scenarios is analysed through simulation}}

	Year = {2000},
	Abstract = {Total order multicast algorithms constitute an important class of problems in distributed systems, especially in the context of fault-tolerance. In short, the problem of total order multicast consists in sending 
messages to a set of processes, in such a way that all messages are delivered by all correct destinations in the 
same order. However, the huge amount of literature on the subject and the plethora of solutions proposed so 
far make it difficult for practitioners to select a solution adapted to their speci
ic problem. As a result, naive 
solutions are often used while better solutions are ignored. 
This paper proposes a classification of total order multicast algorithms based on the ordering mechanism 
of the algorithms, and describes a set of common characteristics (e.g., assumptions, properties) with which 
to evaluate them. In this classification, more than fifty total order broadcast and multicast algorithms are sur- 
veyed. The presentation includes asynchronous algorithms as well as algorithms based on the more restrictive 
synchronous model. Fault-tolerance issues are also considered as the paper studies the properties and behavior 
of the different algorithms with respect to failures.

	Abstract = {We describe a consensus service and suggest its use for the construction of fault-tolerant agreement protocols. We show how to build agreement protocols, using a classical client-server interaction, where: the clients are the processes that must solve the agreement problem; and the servers implement the consensus service. Using a generic notion, called consensus filter, we illustrate our approach on non-blocking atomic commitment and on view synchronous multicast. The approach can trivially be used for total order broadcast. In addition of its modularity, our approach enables efficient implementations of the protocols, and precise characterization of their liveness.}}

	Abstract = {Developers of early distributed systems took a simplistic approach to providing fault tolerance: They just used another copy of the same hardware as a backup. Later, others developed replication software to work on off-the-shelf hardware. Since neither of these methods is especially economical, a logical course is to take it one step further and eliminate the extra hardware altogether.

Fully software-based replication relies on sophisticated techniques to keep track of server communications and ensure the consistency of information across several server replicas. How do you know that each server shares the same view of the data or program semantics? What happens if a server replica crashes? How do you make sure that a system processes invocations in the correct order? These are all problems that a replication technique has to handle. The authors describe two fundamental techniques, primary-backup and active replication, and illustrate how they handle these problems. At this point, both have advantages and disadvantages that depend on the application.

The authors also propose that group communication provides a sufficient framework for implementing software-based replication. The concept of static and dynamic groups proves useful in thinking about how to implement replication techniques. Replication techniques can also use total-order and view-synchronous multicast primitives from group communication.}}

fault-tolerant system shows that administration and software are the
major contributors to failure. Various approaches to software
fault-tolerance are then discussed - notably process-pairs,
transactions and reliable storage. It is pointed out that faults in
production software are often (transient) and that a transaction
mechanism combined with persistent process-pairs provides
fault-tolerant execution - the key to software fault-tolerance.}}

	Abstract = {Over the last years, many replica control protocols have been developed that take advantage of the ordering and reliability semantics of group communication primitives to simplify database system design and to improve performance. Although current solutions are able to mask site failures effectively, many of them are unable to cope with recovery of failed sites, merging of partitions, or joining of new sites. This paper addresses this important issue. It proposes efficient solutions for online system reconfiguration providing new sites with a current state of the database without interrupting transaction processing in the rest of the system. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of cascading reconfigurations, and argues that they can be handled in an elegant way by extended forms of group communication.}}

	Year = {2001},
	Abstract = {Atomic broadcast primitives are often proposed as a mechanism to allow fault-tolerant cooperation between sites in a distributed system. Unfortunately, the delay incurred before a message can be delivered makes it difficult to implement high performance, scalable applications on top of atomic broadcast primitives. Recently, a new approach has been proposed for atomic broadcast which, based on optimistic assumptions about the communication system, reduces the average delay for message delivery to the application. In this paper, we develop this idea further and show how applications can take even more advantage of the optimistic assumption by overlapping the coordination phase of the atomic broadcast algorithm with the processing of delivered messages. In particular, we present a replicated database architecture that employs the new atomic broadcast primitive in such a way that communication and transaction processing are fully overlapped, providing high performance without relaxing transaction correctness.}}

The semantics of the broadcast primitives are simple and easy to understand, but are still powerful. The proposed primitives, for example, guarantee global ordering of broadcast messages. The proposed primitives are also efficient: a reliable broadcast can be done in just slightly more than two messages, so the performance is comparable to a remote procedure call. In addition, the primitives are flexible; user applications can, for example, trade performance against fault-tolerance}}

	Year = {1996},
	Abstract = {Large scale systems are becoming more and more common today. Many distributed applications are emerging that use the capability of world-wide internetworking. Since many applications require availability and consistency in the presence of failures, an adequate support for fault-tolerance is necessary. This can be provided by different paradigms and their implementations. Unfortunately, most of these implementations consider only local area networks, whereas this thesis describes a system, called Phoenix, which aims at large scale networks where additional types of failure have to be taken into account.

This thesis gives a complete description of Phoenix, a toolkit for building fault-tolerant, distributed applications in large scale networks. Fault-tolerance in Phoenix is achieved using replicated process groups, and consistency within one process group is achieved by using view synchronous communication. The particularity of Phoenix is the provision of this fault-tolerance and consistency in a large scale environment, where large scale is two-fold: (1) the wide geographical distribution of the replicated processes, and (2) a high number of participating processes in the system.

The description of Phoenix given here is based on its architecture. Each layer of Phoenix focuses on a particular problem and proposes a solution. Lower layers are responsible for the geographical large scale aspects and their problems, whereas higher layers provide high order communication and deal with numerical large scale aspects.

In large scale networks, in addition to the increased unpredictable latency of messages, communication protocols have to deal with link failures, which are often only transient. The dynamic routing layer in the Phoenix architecture tries to mask these link failures by rerouting. This rerouting not only gives increased reliability of communication, but also a more stable and accurate image of the reachability of the processes.

On top of the dynamic routing layer, the reliable communication layer provides eventually reliable channels, i.e. messages sent are eventually delivered at the destination provided that the sender and the destination processes are correct. This layer takes into account different parameters of large scale networks, such as (1) increased, unpredictable latency, and (2) non-negligible packet desequencing and (3) important packet loss.

The consistency among the replicas is based on a new implementation of the virtually synchronous communication paradigm. The implementation is part of the view synchronous communication layer and is based on a modified consensus protocol together with the eventually reliable channels of the reliable communication layer. The modified consensus protocol itself is based on an unstable suspicion model, where incorrectly suspected processes can be considered alive at a later point. This will be exploited to make the protocol alive whenever a majority of replicas can communicate with each other. The situation where a distributed system is cut into smaller subsystems, and none of these subsystems contains a majority, is not uncommon in large scale, but is often only transient. Further, the dynamic routing layer already does a maximum to avoid this situation.

Based on the view synchronous communication layer, the ordered multicast communication layer provides different ordering primitives based on solid, theoretical definitions, allowing the implementation of different total and uniform orders.

The numerical large scale is considered by assigning different roles to the processes of a distributed system without leaving the context of groups. The idea is to concentrate the fault-tolerant aspect to a small set of core processes, whilst still guaranteeing convenient and efficient access semantics to processes outside these core processes.}}

	Abstract = {Enterprise applications typically store their state in databases. If a database fails, the application is unavailable while the database recovers. Database recovery is time consuming because it involves replaying the persistent transaction log. To isolate end users from database failures, we introduce Pronto, a protocol to orchestrate the transaction processing by multiple, standard databases so that they collectively implement the illusion of a single, highly available database. The key challenge in implementing this illusion is to enable fast failover from one database to another so that database failures do not interrupt the transaction processing. We solve this problem with a novel replication protocol that handles non-determinism without relying on perfect failure detection},

	Abstract = {This paper makes a first attempt to give a precise characterization of liveness in replicated database systems. We introduce the notion of liveness degrees, which express the expectation a database user might have about the termination of transactions, despite concurrency and failures. Our liveness degrees are complementary to the traditional transactional safety degrees (e.g., serializability) and lead to a better characterization of the reliability of replication protocols. We present a generic framework that abstracts several well-known replication protocols and we point out an interesting trade-off between liveness and safety properties in these protocols.}}

	Abstract = {The paper presents a fault tolerant lazy replication protocol that ensures 1-copy serializability at a relatively low cost. Unlike eager replication approaches, our protocol enables local transaction execution and does not lead to any deadlock situation. Compared to previous lazy replication approaches, we significantly reduce the abort rate of transactions and we do not require any reconciliation procedure. Our protocol first executes transactions locally, then broadcasts a transaction certification message to all replica managers, and finally employs a certification procedure to ensure 1-copy serializability. Certification messages are broadcast using a non blocking atomic broadcast primitive, which alleviates the need for a more expensive non blocking atomic commitment algorithm. The certification procedure uses a reordering technique to reduce the probability of transaction aborts}}

However, this consistency criterion has a major drawback because it imposes strong synchronization constraints on the execution of applications which cannot be met efficiently in decentralized systems. In this paper, we examine weaker consistency criteria for computations in which accesses to shared objects are grouped to form transactions. The guarantees provided by transactions (e.g. concurrency and failure atomicity) make them attractive when computations manipulate the state of long-lived objects. We explore two new criteria: causal consistency and causal serializability. These criteria turn out to be sufficient for a class of applications (e.g. collaborative applications) and their implementation results in lesser synchronization and hence improved autonomy, availability and performance. These criteria are formally defined and protocols implementing them are presented.}}

A uniform reliable multicast of a message m has the property that if m has been received by any destination process (faulty or not), then m is received by all processes that reach a decision. Uniform reliable multicast provides a solution to the distributed commit problem. Two multicast primitives are defined in the virtually synchronous model: reliable multicast (called view-atomic) and uniform reliable multicast (called uniform view-atomic). The view-atomic multicast is used to implement the uniform view-atomic primitive. As view-atomicity is based on the concept of process group membership, a connection is established between the process group membership and the distributed commit problems}}

	Abstract = {This report describes the design of a Replication Framework that facilitates the implementation and com-parison of database replication techniques. Furthermore, it discusses the implementation of a Database Replication Prototype and compares the performance measurements of two replication techniques based on the Atomic Broadcast communication primitive: pessimistic active replication and optimistic active replication. The main contributions of this report can be split into four parts. Firstly, a framework is proposed that accommodates the comparison of various replication techniques. Secondly, the implementation requirements and the theoretical performance characteristics of the pessimistic and the optimistic active replication techniques are thoroughly analysed. Thirdly, the two techniques have been implemented within the framework as a proof of concept, forming the Database Replication Prototype. Finally, we present the performance results obtained using the Database Replication Prototype. They show that in large-scale networks, optimistic active replication outperforms pessimistic active replication.

The solutions developed from these two perspectives are conceptually similar but differ in many aspects: model, assumptions, mechanisms, guarantees provided, and implementation. In this paper, we provide an abstract and ``neutral'' framework to compare replication techniques from both communities. The framework has been designed to emphasize the role played by different mechanisms and to facilitate comparisons. The paper describes the replication techniques used in both communities, compares them, and points out ways in which they can be integrated to arrive to better, more robust replication protocols.}}

	Abstract = {Data replication is an increasingly important topic as databases are increasingly deployed over clusters of workstations. One of the challenges in database replication is to introduce replication without severely affecting performance. Because of this difficulty, current database products use lazy replication, which is very efficient but can compromise consistency. As an alternative, eager replication guarantees consistency but most existing, protocols have a prohibitive cost. In order to clarify the current state of the art and open up new avenues for research, this paper analyzes existing eager techniques using three key parameters. In our analysis, we distinguish eight classes of eager replication protocols and, for each category, discuss its requirements, capabilities, and cost. The contribution lies in showing when eager replication is feasible and in spelling out the different aspects a database, replication protocol must account for.}}

We identify two definitions:  weak total order and strong total order, which are at the extremes of the proposed hierarchy, and incorporate them into a consistent design. Finally, we propose high-level algorithms based on a virtually synchronous communication environment that implement the given definitions.}}

	Abstract = {Databases are an important part of today's IT infrastructure: both companies and state institutions rely on database systems to store most of their important data. As we are more and more dependent on database systems, securing this key facility is now a priority. Because of this, research on fault-tolerant database systems is of increasing importance.

One way to ensure the fault-tolerance of a system is by replicating it. Replication is a natural way to deal with failures: if one copy is not available, we use another one. However implementing consistent replication is not easy. Database replication is hardly a new area of research: the first papers on the subject are more than twenty years old. Yet how to build an efficient, consistent replicated database is still an open research question.

Recently, a new approach to solve this problem has been proposed. The idea is to rely on some communication infrastructure called group communications. This infrastructure offers some high-level primitives that can help in the design and the implementation of a replicated database. While promising, this approach to database replication is still in its infancy.

This thesis focuses on group communication-based database replication and strives to give an overall understanding of this topic. This thesis has three major contributions. In the structural domain, it introduces a classification of replication techniques. In the qualitative domain, an analysis of fault-tolerance semantics is proposed. Finally, in the quantitative domain, a performance evaluation of group communication-based database replication is presented.

The classification gives an overview of the different means to implement database replication. Techniques described in the literature are sorted using this classification. The classification highlights structural similarities of techniques originating from different communities (database community and distributed system community). For each category of the classification, we also analyse the requirements imposed on the database component and group communication primitives that are needed to enforce consistency.

Group communication-based database replication implies building a system from two different components: a database system and a group communication system. Fault-tolerance is an end-to-end property: a system built from two components tends to be as fault-tolerant as the weakest component. The analysis of fault-tolerance semantics show what fault-tolerance guarantee is ensured by group communication based replication techniques. Additionally a new faulttolerance guarantee, group-safety, is proposed. Group-safety is better suited to group communication-based database replication. We also show that group-safe replication techniques can offer improved performance.

Finally, the performance evaluation offers a quantitative view of group communication based replication techniques. The performance of group communication techniques and classical database replication techniques is compared. The way those different techniques react to different loads is explored. Some optimisation of group communication techniques are also described and their performance benefits evaluated.}}

Moshe is designed with three new significant features that are important in this setting: it avoids delivering views that reflect out-of-date memberships; it requires a single round of messages in the common case; and it employs a client-server design for scalability. Furthermore, Moshe's interface supplies the hooks needed to provide clients with full virtual synchrony semantics. We have implemented Moshe on top of a network event mechanism also designed specifically for use in a WAN. In addition to specifying the properties of the algorithm and proving that this specification is met, we provide empirical results of an implementation of Moshe running over the Internet. The empirical results justify the assumptions made by our design and exhibit good performance. In particular, Moshe terminates within a single communication round over 98% of the time. The experimental results also lead to interesting observations regarding the performance of membership algorithms over the Internet.}}

	Abstract = {The predominant models to perform network and systems{\newline}                 management have traditionally been SNMP and CMIP.{\newline}                 However, SNMP is beginning to reach its limits when{\newline}                 more complex management tasks are to be performed, and{\newline}                 CMIP -- owing to its complexity and slow{\newline}                 standardization process -- has not yet gained the same{\newline}                 acceptance as SNMP. The advent of object-oriented{\newline}                 distributed processing models has brought forward a{\newline}                 third candidate, CORBA, originally not targeted{\newline}                 specifically at management tasks, but in many respects{\newline}                 nevertheless suitable for managing both local and wide{\newline}                 area networks. CORBA is more powerful than SNMP and{\newline}                 less complex than CMIP. Its affiliation with C++, a{\newline}                 widely used programming language, lends it to immediate{\newline}                 use by a huge number of programmers and allows them to{\newline}                 introduce distribution into their programs without a{\newline}                 too drastic change of philosophy. It is therefore{\newline}                 assumed that CORBA will become important in the network{\newline}                 and systems management domain as well as in the{\newline}                 distributed systems domain. To be more precise, CORBA{\newline}                 will be used to implement management applications{\newline}                 (managers) and managed entities (agents). The author{\newline}                 assumes that, in the near future, all models will have{\newline}                 to coexist, because investments in older models have{\newline}                 been made, because CORBA may not yet be ready for{\newline}                 certain specialized management tasks (e.g. embedded{\newline}                 management agents), or simply for political reasons.{\newline}                 Therefore, the need arises to manage a system written{\newline}                 in one model from a system written in a different{\newline}                 model, for example to manage an OSI agent using a{\newline}                 CORBA-based manager. Assuming that CORBA will achieve{\newline}                 broad acceptance in the management world, it would be{\newline}                 desirable to be able to manage other models{\newline}                 transparently from CORBA. The benefits would be{\newline}                 investment protection of existing managed entities, the{\newline}                 opening of the SNMP- and CMIP-dominated management{\newline}                 world to management-inexperienced (CORBA) programmers,{\newline}                 and the unification of management in one common,{\newline}                 simple, and yet powerful model. The goal of this work{\newline}                 is to examine how CORBA can be used for network and{\newline}                 systems management. The focus is on the client side;{\newline}                 that is, how CORBA can be used to implement management{\newline}                 applications that access managed entities, rather than{\newline}                 how CORBA can be used to implement managed entities.{\newline}                 Work in this area already exists; an overview will be{\newline}                 given and it will be shown that most work focuses on{\newline}                 compile-time static translation of one model to{\newline}                 another. This generates a number of problems. Therefore{\newline}                 a dynamic runtime-based approach is proposed that{\newline}                 eliminates these problems and has several advantages{\newline}                 over static approaches. The proposed model is a{\newline}                 combination of a generic object model, metadata, and{\newline}                 adapters that convert between the generic and specific{\newline}                 target models. Although the elements of the proposed{\newline}                 models are established and well known, their{\newline}                 combination and their application to the domain of{\newline}                 management is novel and makes for the issues of{\newline}                 interest in this thesis.}}

detection service for Grid systems. More specifically, traditional
implementations of failure detectors are often tuned for running over
local networks and fail to address some important problems found in
wide-area distributed systems, such as Grid systems. We identify some of
the most important problems raised in the context of Grids. We then
survey recent propositions that can help in solving some of these problems.

	Abstract = {We study the quality of service (QoS) of failure detectors. By QoS, we mean a specification that quantifies 1) how fast the failure detector detects actual failures and 2) how well it avoids false detections. We first propose a set of QoS metrics to specify failure detectors for systems with probabilistic behaviors, i.e., for systems where message delays and message losses follow some probability distributions. We then give a new failure detector algorithm and analyze its QoS in terms of the proposed metrics. We show that, among a large class of failure detectors, the new algorithm is optimal with respect to some of these QoS metrics. Given a set of failure detector QoS requirements, we show how to compute the parameters of our algorithm so that it satisfies these requirements and we show how this can be done even if the probabilistic behavior of the system is not known. We then present some simulation results that show that the new failure detector algorithm provides a better QoS than an algorithm that is commonly used in practice. Finally, we suggest some ways to make our failure detector adaptive to changes in the probabilistic behavior of the network. }}

A decomposition of the group communication into services is presented, along with a description of applicable standards. As an example, a group membership service based on the LDAP standard is discussed.}}

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the safety guarantees of group communication-based database replication techniques. We show that there is a model mismatch between group communication and database, and because of this, classical group communication systems cannot be used to build 2-safe database replication. We propose a new group communication primitive called end-to-end atomic broadcast that solves the problem, i.e., can be used to implement 2-safe database replication. We also introduce a new safety criterion, called group-safety, that has advantages both over 1-safety and 2-safety. Experimental results show the gain of efficiency of group-safety over lazy replication, which ensures only 1-safety.}}

	Abstract = {Atomic broadcast primitives are often proposed as a mechanism to allow fault-tolerant cooperation between sites in a distributed system. Unfortunately, the delay incurred before a message can be delivered makes it difficult to implement high performance, scalable applications on top of atomic broadcast primitives. Recently, a new approach has been proposed for atomic broadcast which, based on optimistic assumptions about the communication system, reduces the average delay for message delivery to the application. In this paper, we develop this idea further and show how applications can take even more advantage of the optimistic assumption by overlapping the coordination phase of the atomic broadcast algorithm with the processing of delivered messages. In particular, we present a replicated database architecture that employs the new atomic broadcast primitive in such a way that communication and transaction processing are fully overlapped, providing high performance without relaxing transaction correctness.}}

	Abstract = {Group communication provides communication primitives with various semantics and their use greatly simplifies the development of highly available services. However, despite tremendous advances in research and numerous prototypes, group communication stays confined to small niches and academic prototypes. In contrast, message-oriented middleware such as the Java Messaging Service (JMS) is widely used, and has become a de-facto standard. We believe that the lack of standard interfaces is the reason that hinders the deployment of group communication systems. Since JMS is well-established, an interesting solution is to map group communication primitives onto the JMS API. This requires to adapt the traditional specifications of group communication in order to take into account the features of JMS. The resulting group communication API, together with corresponding specifications, defines group communication primitives compatible with the JMS syntax and semantics.}}

	Abstract = {It is widely recognized that distributed systems would greatly benefit
from the availability of a generic failure detection service. There
are however several issues that must be addressed before such a
service can actually be implemented.

In this paper, we highlight the main issues related to ensuring
failure detection in large-scale systems, and overview the main
solutions proposed in the literature so far. Then, we outline a
pragmatic architecture for a failure detector service based on the
?-failure detector, and a combination of techniques proposed
in related work.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we study the safety guarantees of group communication-based database replication techniques. We show that there is a model mismatch between group communication and database, and because of this, classical group communication systems cannot be used to build 2-safe database replication. We propose a new group communication primitive called end-to-end atomic broadcast that solves the problem, i.e., can be used to implement 2-safe database replication. We also introduce a new safety criterion, called group-safety, that has advantages both over 1-safety and 2-safety. Experimental results show the gain of efficiency of group-safety over lazy replication, which ensures only 1-safety. }}
