        identity-based loading (SIBL) which provides multiple

        partitions, where n is the number of supported

        One solution would group the local hosts and services

    abstract = "As IP technologies providing both tremendous
        capacity and the ability to establish dynamic secure
        associations between endpoints emerge, virtual private
        networks (VPNs) are going through dramatic growth. The
        number of endpoints per VPN is growing and the
        communication pattern between endpoints is becoming
        increasingly hard to forecast. Consequently, users are
        demanding dependable, dynamic connectivity between
        endpoints, with the network expected to accommodate any
        traffic matrix, as long as the traffic to the endpoints
        does not overwhelm the rates of the respective ingress
        and egress links. We propose a new service interface,
        termed a hose, to provide the appropriate performance
        abstraction. A hose is characterized by the aggregate
        traffic to and from one endpoint in the VPN to the set
        of other endpoints in the VPN, and by an associated
        performance guarantee. Hoses provide important advantages
        to a VPN customer: (i) flexibility to send traffic to a
        set of endpoints without having to specify the detailed
        traffic matrix, and (ii) reduction in the size of access
        links through multiplexing gains obtained from the natural
        aggregation of the flows between endpoints. As compared
        with the conventional point to point (or customer-pipe)
        model for managing QoS, hoses provide reduction in the
        state information a customer must maintain. On the other
        hand, hoses would appear to increase the complexity of
        the already difficult problem of resource management to
        support QoS. To manage network resources in the face of
        this increased uncertainty, we consider both conventional
        statistical multiplexing techniques, and a new resizing
        technique based on online measurements. To study these
        performance issues, we run trace driven simulations,
        using traffic derived from AT\&T's voice network, and
        from a large corporate data network. From the customer's
        perspective, we find that aggregation of traffic at the
        hose level provides significant multiplexing gains. From
        the provider's perspective, we find that the statistical
        multiplexing and resizing techniques deal effectively
        with uncertainties about the traffic, providing
        significant gains over the conventional alternative of
        a mesh of statically sized customer-pipes between
        endpoints.",

        towards enabling nomadic Internet users. It allows a
        mobile node to maintain and use the same IP address even
        as it changes its point of attachment to the Internet.
        Mobility implies higher security risks than static
        operation. Portable devices may be stolen or their traffic
        may, at times, pass through links with questionable
        security characteristics. Most commercial organizations
        use some combination of source-filtering routers,
        sophisticated firewalls, and private address spaces to
        protect their network from unauthorized users. The basic
        Mobile IP protocol fails in the presence of these
        mechanisms even for authorized users. This paper describes
        enhancements that enable Mobile IP operation in such
        environments, i.e., they allow a mobile user, out on a
        public portion of the Internet, to maintain a secure
        virtual presence within his firewall-protected office

        network (VPN) implementation strategy. His first question
        is if they know what a VPN is. The answer, when the fog
        around the issue gets cleared up, is usually ''no''. But,
        they have been reading about them and feel a need to
        implement a strategy or get left behind in the technology
        curve that eludes us all. Basically, a VPN in today's
        networked environment is an IP connection between two
        sites over a public IP network which has its payload
        traffic encrypted such that only the source and
        destination can decrypt the traffic packets. In this
        manner, a publicly accessible network can be used for
        highly confidential information in a secure manner. Of
        course, this type of security can be mostly implemented
        by pre encrypting files and other user data before
        transmission, but it is not quite as secure as a VPN.
        VPNs provide further security as they are capable of
        encrypting not only the actual user data, but many of
        the protocol stack informational items which may be used
        to compromise a customer site in a technical session

        The data networking industry has produced various
        protocols-for example, layer 2 forwarding (L2F) and
        point-to-point tunneling protocol (PPTP)-to provide VPDN
        services. Based on these protocols, a new integrated VPDN
        protocol, layer 2 tunneling protocol (L2TP), is currently
        being designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
        (IETF). However, this solution is only meant to deal with
        a wired network environment. In this paper, we describe
        and compare different solutions that extend the wired
        VPDN service model over the various wireless access
        network technologies. The first set of solutions uses
        network-layer protocols such as IETF's mobile Internet
        protocol (IP) to perform macromobility management. In
        addition, IETF's secure IP (IPSEC) protocols may be used
        when security features are desired. The first set of
        solutions differs from the wired VPDN model only in
        terms of the location of the home agent (whether it
        resides in the access provider's network or the corporate
        network) and the availability of a hierarchical
        architecture to minimize hand-off latency. The second
        set of solutions uses both link-layer (for example, L2TP)
        and network-layer (for example, mobile IP) protocols to
        perform macromobility management. Some alternatives
        require the mobile hosts to play a more proactive role-
        for example, the voluntary tunneling approach. We briefly

        communication groups that protect significant information in
        departmental and/or individual bases. To satisfy the demands,
        encryption elements in the system need to have exact and
        complicated process information. In general, this information
        is generated in a management server and downloaded to the
        encryption elements, every time the system configuration
        changes. In this paper, we propose Group Search Protocol, by
        which encryption elements generate the process information
        automatically from the logical definition of the secure
        communication groups for themselves. By this method, secure
        communication groups for intranet with location free is
        realized, that is to say, users who have the function of
        encryption elements can move anywhere in the intranet
        freely.",

    abstract = "Bugs in network application programs can be
        exploited to compromise the system on which the
        application is running. When running these applications
        in an unsafe environment such as the Internet, the
        security concerns raised are a significant barrier to
        electronic commerce. In addition, these application
        programs such as web servers, mailservers, etc., are
        usually too big and complex to be bug free; trying to
        build security directly into these applications has
        been proven very difficult. The purpose of the paper
        is to demonstrate that Compartmented Mode Workstation
        is a suitable platform to provide a secure environment
        that can contain most existing network applications.
        We describe how to wrap these applications to reduce
        the potential for a security breach without the need
        to rewrite the application completely. By minimizing
        the effort of transferring unsafe application services
        to be reasonably secure, we are able to accelerate
        the process of electronic commerce.",
