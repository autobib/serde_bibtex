A combination of Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA)
and p-persistent Inhibit Sense Multiple Access (ISMA) protocols is
proposed for Indoor Wireless Communications (IWC).  The combination of
these two protocols is called the hybrid CDMA/ISMA protocol.  The
performance of the hybrid CDMA/ISMA protocol is analyzed with a Markov
model considering Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) modulation. 
The performance is measured in terms of throughput and delay. The
performance is also evaluated using computer simulation of which the
results are in close agreement with the Markov model results. 
The study of indoor wireless communications using a hybrid DMA/ISMA
protocol can be useful for various applications in research and design
offices, medical data communication in hospitals, etc."

High speed (60 Mb/s) QPSK/OQPSK burst modem Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSICs), which are greatly useful for radio units to be compact, economical and maintenance-free, are introduced.  These VLSICs enable modems to eliminate the analog devices such as mixers required for baseband modulation and zero-IF conversion in demodulation, an analog voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) for bit timing recovery and a voltage controlled attenuator for automatic gain control (AGC).  In addition to the full-digital implementation, the demodulator VLSIC achieves fast carrier-acquisition for burst mode operation by employing a reverse-modulation carrier recovery scheme capable of operating for OQPSK signals, and fast clock-acquisition by using a bit-timing recovery scheme with bit-timing estimation and interpolation coupled with a pulse-shaping filter.  Results of experiment on the assumption of a video time division multiple access (TDMA) system show that the developed VLSICs perform well at the high speed (60 Mb/s) and with the short preamble words (80 symbols)."

Future terminals will allow users untethered access to multi-media information serves that are interconnected through high-bandwidth network backbones.  This paper describes a chipset for such a terminal, to transmit audio and pen input from the user to the network on a wireless uplink and to receive audio, text/graphics and compressed video from the backbone on the down link.  The portability requirement results in the primary design focus on power reduction.  Six chips provide the interface between a high-speed digital radio modem and a commercial speech codec, pen input circuitry, and LCD panels for text/graphics and full-motion video display.  The chips provide protocol conversion, synchronization, error correction, packetization, buffering, video decompression, and D/A conversion at power consumption less than 5mW.  A 6b DAC to drive the LCD operates down to 1.3V, uses minimum-size devices for digital decoding, a single-ended architecture to reduce the average power by a factor of 2 and a low-voltage current reference, and consumes on average 500 mu W at 2.5MHz and 0.7Vpp output amplitude.  The specifications of the chipset fabricated in 1.2 mu m technology are given."

The performance of integrated voice/data wireless DS-CDMA networks is studied in this paper.  Due to the specific nature of the multiplexing method for CDMA networks, the performance of transmission services depends on the number of active users in the network.  Bit error rate formulae for voice and data calls are obtained as functions of the numbers of active voice and data calls.  The blocking probability of voice calls is determined for a call access administration strategy with preemptive priority for voice calls.  The improvement in the performance of data calls as a result of the application of ARQ techniques is examined.  Formulae for the virtual transmission rate of data calls are derived.  This work provides an approach to understanding the complex relationship between the grade of service and the number of active users in CDMA networks.  Based on the results, a bandwidth management strategy is proposed for CDMA networks transporting multimedia services.  In order to mitigate the congestion of data calls under fully loaded cell conditions, a throttling back rate reduction method is studied."

Only recently has our technology advanced to the point that commercial application of spread-spectrum signaling is economically feasible.  This has motivated a number of companies and individuals to seek new ways to benefit from spread-spectrum techniques in commercial systems and products.  In this paper, we give a very brief overview of spread-spectrum signaling.  We then consider applications to satellite mobile applications as well as indoor wireless applications.  An overview is presented of several proposals to provide worldwide personal communications through satellite-based spread-spectrum systems, the tradeoffs to be considered, and the controversies involved.  A description of a high-capacity wireless office telephone system serves to illustrate how spread-spectrum signaling may be useful in this environment.  Finally, we describe a number of digital processing algorithms and devices that implement spread-spectrum signaling in a cost-effective manner."

Simulations have shown that the benefits of this radio based advanced automatic train control system are appreciable reductions in operational headway, in energy consumption, and in elapsed time for consists to traverse their routes."

Current trends in personal and data communication networks favour code division multiple access (CDMA) as a solution to spectral congestion.  This is because of enhanced capacity, security, network flexibility, simplified protocol, and relative immunity to propagation induced errors such as multipath and interference, as compared with traditional frequency division multiple access (FDMA).  Various CDMA schemes have been proposed and described in relation to VSAT systems, local area microcells, and cellular telephones.  Additionally, numerous product applications have emerged in the areas of modems, voice links and wireless local exchanges.  These systems require inter- and intra-cell control.  By contrast, the scheme presented in this paper places no reliance on intercell protocol.  It enables new cells to be added to the network without any impact on the hardware.  Network reconfiguration requires software changes only.  Therefore, the scheme is appropriate to systems which demand flexibility with minimum overheads."

The ways in which people communicate are changing rapidly.  No longer is the conventional voice call over a wired network the only reasonable and reliable method of transmitting information.  Instead, the options are many and diverse, ranging from voice calls over wireless networks, to video calls over the conventional wired network, ISDN video, FAX, e-mail, voice mail, beeper, services, data services, audio teleconferencing, and so-called scribble phone service (transmission of arbitrary hand written input).  This revolution in communications is being fueled by several sources, including the availability of low-cost, low-power,computation in both DSP and RISC chips, larger and cheaper memory chips, improved algorithms for communications (e.g., modems, signaling) and signal processing, and finally the creation of world-wide standards for transmission, signal compression, and communication protocols.  The broad goal of the communications revolution is to provide seamless and high-quality communications between people (or groups of people), anywhere, anytime, and at a reasonable price.  Although there are many technologies that form the bases for the communications environment of the twenty-first century, one of the key technologies for making the vision a reality is voice processing.  In this paper we attempt to show, by example, how voice processing has been applied to specific problems in telecommunications systems of the twenty-first 
century."

Code-division multiple access (CDMA) has emerged as a technique of choice in wireless applications such as cellular communications and local-area networks (LANs).  One of its advantages is that it does not require accurate frequency or time-interval separation between users, so transmissions may overlap in time and spectrum.  In addition, the method allows flexibility in the number of simultaneous users transmitting into a given channel.  CDMA also provides superior operating tolerance for both multipath and narrowband interference."

Wireless systems engineering is developing into a more conscious search for the best common culture for multiple users in a real environment.  In this article, some of the related European developments of two different personal communication services, digital cellular telephone and mobile data networks, are compared with each other.  The development of novel wireless technologies in the past 15 years has spurred a fascinating drive towards new Multi-user systems and applications on either side of the Atlantic ocean.  But while the enabling technologies are largely the same, some clear differences in the approach and involvement of European and American regulatory standardization bodies can be noted.  The stronger European tradition of involvement of public authorities in the telecommunications leads to firmer and more widely accepted standards for new public wireless systems, such as GSM, DECT, teletext and RDS.  These common standards are proving of great commercial value not only to European manufacturers and system integrators of mobile infrastructure, but also to terminal equipment manufacturers, service operators and users world-wide."

The technique uses optical filtering to select only two optical modes in the pulsed laser spectrum that beat together in a high-speed photodiode.

Analytical and simulation results on specific channels demonstrate that an adaptive decision-feedback equalizer adapted according to the least-mean-squares algorithm recovers most of the performance degradation.  We also evaluate the performance of a timing-recovery phase-locked loop operating independent of the adaptive equalizer; showing that it quickly and accurately determines the sampling phase with negligible performance degradation.

Mobility and personal communications is Area 4 of seven principal areas of research identified in the ACTS Programme.  The preparation of the workplan for this element of ACTS exposed differences of view among contributors to the 'Task' definition process.  On one hand, there was a strong feeling that evolution of GSM/DCS 1800 would meet the targets originally defined for UMTS, but on the other, the perceived need for individual users to have access to bandwidth on demand in the third environment pointed to a more radical approach.  The work plan which ultimately emerged, accommodates both positions in that it presupposes that by the year 2000, the personal communications environment will offer a continuum of services embracing presently conceived UMTS, the Mobile Broadband Service (MBS) and Wireless LAN capability.  The emphasis in ACTS has, however, shifted from fundamental of enabling technology to 'service and application' and to investigating these aspects by offering the new service to communities of potential real users via 'National Host' network."

Wireless data networks are unique in that there are three key aspects to a complete solution: the network, the radio modem and the application.  As wireless data networks emerged, the focus was on architecting the network and designing small, power efficient modems.  Little effort was focused on the connectivity of the network (and modem) to higher operating systems and application layers.  This is true whether for fixed side to hosts, LAN servers, etc, or to proper interfaces on the mobile operating system.  This paper will explore how the major wide area wireless data networks (RAM, Ardis, CDPD) have approached the problem of connectivity, and discuss the key software interfaces.  Specialized transport protocols, high level API's and low level drive issues will be compared and contrasted."

An evaluation of a direct sequence spread spectrum wireless LAN based on interference cancellation techniques is presented, using a simulation toolset based on a hierarchical block diagram approach.  Good orthogonality between spreading codes with near-perfect average power control is essential for adequate spectrum efficiency in conventional CDMA applications but good average power control is often difficult to maintain.  Interference Cancellation Code Division Multiple Access (IC-CDMA) is a method proposed for third generation mobile systems which considerably improves the user capacity of a spread spectrum system.  IC-CDMA does not require equal received powers thereby eliminating the need for complex power control algorithms.  The results obtained illustrate that IC-CDMA is generally more suitable for a cellular application than conventional CDMA."

This paper examines a radio-based indoor communication network with a single radio channel shared by several data terminals.  By enabling the terminals to communicate with each other and access the resources of a wired network, the system is a potential provider of in-building LAN-like services.  In this indoor fading environment, a base-station approach is assumed.  In the analysis, a two-state Markov chain model is used to model the nonstationary transmission channel.  Two preemptive polling multiple-access schemes combine with ARQ error-control schemes to counteract the effects of a nonstationary transmission channel.  The main idea here devised is that of making the service interruption dependent on the propagation conditions of the transmission channel by monitoring the outcomes of the data packet transmission attempts.  A performance comparison reveals the superiority of the preemptive polling systems with respect to a classical TDMA scheme."

In a connection-oriented Wireless LAN, the mobility of mobile hosts 
results in the establishment and disconnection of new and old virtual circuits.  The resulting increase in signalling traffic along with the need to support multi-media stream handovers demand a fast, continuous and bandwidth-efficient handover protocol.  In this paper, we adopt a handover scheme based on partial re-establishments, where a new partial path converges to an existing path.  Connection re-routing (CR) operations are then performed at the convergence/crossover switch (CX).  To achieve localised handovers, a wireless cell clustering scheme is proposed.   The clustering of base stations to cluster switches (CLSs) provides fast intra-cluster handovers since the CR operations are performed at the CLS.  To support fast inter-cluster handovers, four CX discovery schemes (Loose Select, Prior Path, Distributed Hunt and Backward Tracking) are introduced.  Simulation results obtained from a trace-driven mobile network simulator on four different network topologies (Random, Star, Tree and Hierarchical Redundancy) reveal that both Prior Path and Distributed Hunt discoveries outperform the others by providing the fastest convergence with shorter resulting paths and higher circuit reuse efficiency."

One of the most interesting changes in business practices is telecommuting, namely doing work in places other than the corporate offices.  The extent of telecommuting has been on the rise during the 1990s and it is expected to rise rapidly during the next few years.  A major driving force in the spread of telecommuting is the increased availability of cost-effective supportive information technologies.  The tasks performed by telecommuters are expanding.  While the early telecommuters performed repeated transactions (such as processing insurance claims at home), today's telecommuters can perform at home, or on the road, almost any task that they do at the office.  Thus, their information needs have been changed.  This paper examines the various tasks performed by telecommuters and surveys the major supporting information technologies.  Special attention is given to electronic mail, accessibility to databases and networks, desk top teleconferencing, personal digital assistants (PDAs), screen sharing, workflow systems, idea generation, and distributed group decision making.  Also, Lotus Notes is viewed as a major computing environment that will facilitate telecommuting.  Technological developments in an integrated services digital network (ISDN), an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), wireless communication, and local area network (LAN) connectivity will have a major impact on the growth of telecommuting and so will the resolution of managerial issues such as appropriate controls and security, cost-benefit justification, training and ownership and maintenance of the necessary equipment at home."

In this paper, the theoretical capacity efficiency is calculated and compared against other methods, non-bridging (i.e., direct communications) and full-time bridging (i.e., the access point always bridges data.).

Wireless ATM LANs have the potential to support multi-Mb/s bandwidths to mobile users with guaranteed quality of service.  However, the lossy nature of the wireless medium will pose problems for loss-sensitive applications.  Techniques to minimize the effect of these losses will therefore be required.  In this paper, we examine the use of combined source and channel coding for MPEG video transport in a wireless ATM environment.  Although forward error correction (FEC) provides protection against channel bit errors, the bandwidth overhead can become a significant drawback in a fixed bandwidth scenario.  Additional protection against losses can be realized by using two-layer video coding.  In this work, we compare the performance of a 1-layer main profile and 2-layer data partitioning and SNR scalable MPEG-2 encoders in a system with random channel errors and forward error correction.  The results indicate that if the channel bit error rate is known an optimum FEC level can be chosen for the 1-layer case.  However, at this fixed FEC level, if a critical bit error rate is exceeded then video quality degrades dramatically.  The 2-layer cases appear to lead to more graceful degradation in quality at this critical bit error rates.  In particular, SNR scalability may lead to better video quality over a larger range of bit error rates than a 1-layer approach."

This paper describes a generalized network architecture for the interworking of wireless access systems (supporting wireless data users) to wireline networks (on which there are data services), and discusses the implementation of particular elements of the architecture. The generalized architecture describes wireless data users connected to services on wireline networks by way of an intermediate network and an appropriate interworking function (IWF). The intermediate network could be implemented in a variety of ways, such as a circuit-switched, centralized packet-switched, or a local area network (LAN). The IWF adapts radio protocols to those on the wireline network, and buffers the remote data service from user movement. The impacts of basic data call handling (call origination, call delivery, and handoff) on the intermediate network are the principle topic."

The emulator can be used with any application which uses UDP and requires only minimal changes to the application or, it may be used with applications written using the ANSAware distributed systems platform in which case no changes are necessary to the application.

Two applications have been identified for wireless local area network (LAN) technology in the forward area of the battlefield: a soldier radio and distributed command posts. The Army's soldier radio/soldier computer initiative is characterized by low to medium data rate requirements (10 kbps or higher), optimization for low cost and light weight, and fully-mobile operation. It utilizes the UHF or low SHF bands, and has a range to 2 km. The distributed command posts application is characterized by high data rate requirements (1 to 10   Mbps), optimization for low probability of intercept (LPI) or detection (LPD), and quasi-mobile operation (rapid setup after a move). It utilizes the EHF band, and has a range to 10 km. The authors survey requirements and architectural alternatives for both applications. The issues which make current commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology unsuitable for a tactical environment are examined, and modifications which may be made to COTS equipment to deal with these issues are proposed. These issues include operation on the   move, high-loss propagation path, frequency band, security requirements, and interference rejection. echnologies which are common to the two applications are identified.

The aim of current mobile computing systems is to hide the network as far as possible from applications. This paper introduces location-aware computing, which makes details of the networked computing environment explicitly available to applications. Objects which move, such as people and equipment, are electronically tagged. Depending upon where a person is located and the capabilities of the machines around a person, the applications alter their behaviour. This automates tasks such as logging on and telephone re-routing. Applications automatically modify themselves to make best use of a person's nearby environment. Audit trails may be created, detailing the person's or object's movement, allowing time-and-motion studies to be conducted and the analysis of product movement efficiency within a factory. It is argued that a location-aware computing system must address the three main issues of information gathering, data structures and querying, and access control. Ideas within these areas are introduced and explained, and the concepts of `co-location' and `spheres of influence' are suggested as paradigms of person-machine interaction."

DECT is the European standard for digital cordless telecommunication. Currently, most DECT systems have been established as standard PABX islands only. However, emerging application areas for DECT networks include data communication oriented mobile computing, making OSI conformance a major issue. This paper presents an approach towards the integration of mobile and fixed OSI-based networks using DECT as an example. Problems to be addressed include the registration, tracking and localization of mobile users roaming across cooperating DECT islands, in order to provide network-wide reachability and service access. We propose the ITU-T X.500 directory service as the natural solution to this problem. Using X.500 enables mapping of a DECT international portable users identity onto the user's current location. After briefly introducing the DECT and the X.500 standard, different schemes for location management using X.500 are discussed. Once the X.500 directory system is established, it can be accessed and utilized by telecommunication services and mobile applications. Examples include wireless access to an overall X.400 service as well as trading services for X.9tr based mobile distributed computing applications."

In recent years, the rapid advancements of wireless communication
  technology and computer down-sizing technology have enabled users to
  utilize computing resources anywhere in the computer network. New
  applications constructed on the mobile database system are becoming
  popular. However, the current database systems do not provide special
  facilities for specific update operations in a mobile computing

  First, we review the difficulties of dynamic update of databases in a

  solution for these difficulties. In order to construct an AMDS, we focus

In this article, we consider wireless ATM concepts for small LANs,

  wireless ATM LAN framework architecture that supports wireless ATM
  communications in environments with and without fixed ATM infrastructure.
  For the configuration with ATM infrastructure, a distributed ATM switched
  backbone is proposed, which enables a smart ATM switching element to be
  embedded in every wireless and fixed access point. For bandwidth
  efficiency and ease of operation (place-and-play), we also propose an ad
  hoc wireless ATM LAN concept based on the same 5 GHz wireless ATM air
  interface as is currently under standardization in ETSI/BRAN and ATM
  Forum. Unlike CSMA-based ad hoc systems such as HIPERLAN and IEEE802.11,
  our ad hoc wireless ATM system makes QoS management feasible in an
  infrastructureless environment by using resource reservation and scheduled
  medium access protocol. Since cost scalability is essential throughout our
  system design, we consider forwarding between ad hoc subnets and
  interworking with the fixed network as important but optional features.",

Recent and anticipated technological advances in wireless
   computing will permit users to compute ubiquitously, 'anywhere' and
   'any time'. However, mobile platforms are unlikely to have the
   computational resources to solve even moderately complex problems
   that users routinely solve on static workstations today. In the
   SciencePad project our aim is to develop 'ubiquitous' problem solving
   environments (UPSEs) to support mobile aware applications. The
   objective of this paper is to address the architectural design of
   UPSEs on wireless notebook platforms supported by stationary servers
   over low bandwidth connections. There is extensive literature dealing
   with networking and data management issues in mobile computing.
   However, we address design issues at several layers of the mobile
   system. The resulting architecture uses a proxy-based methodology to
   partition the application components across the dual (wireless and
   stationary) network of computational units and build a distributed
   PSE architecture. Our architecture uses parameterized objects and
   templates, lazy evaluation, and also deals with fuzzy and
   unstructured I/O. We articulate the general principal of the
   architecture in the context of scientific computing, which provides
   us with a complex, real world application scenario. It also allows us
   to build on our previous work on various aspects of PSEs for
   scientific computing. Our architecture is currently being validated
   by building a ubiquitous version of PDELab (a scientific computing
   package) on a two mega-bit wireless Ethernet network of notebook

An implicit assumption underlying most networking
   research has been that two Internet users would be connected only by
   fixed links (wire lines). Increased use of portable computers,
   wireless networks and satellites has generated interest in supporting
   'computing on the move', or mobile computing. Instead of maintaining
   a fixed position in a network, users in this environment are free to
   roam. Mobile computing raises interesting issues, such as how to
   route packets as the mobile user (host) moves about and how to
   guarantee the quality of service (QOS) that an application running on
   such a mobile host may need. Other issues include the choice of a
   transport protocol to use on top of a mobile host and how to deal
   with poor performance in wireless links. There are two possible
   approaches to supporting mobile computing over the Internet. The
   first uses a mobile IP (Internet Protocol), whereby packets
   (datagrams) are forwarded by a designated stationary host to the
   mobile host. The second approach involves wireless ATM (asynchronous

Future ubiquitous computing systems are predicated on
   plentiful network bandwidth. End-systems for this mass marketplace
   must be cheap and, above all, simple-to-use. Proposals are already

   bandwidth to make both clients and servers stateless, i.e. needing to

   have achieved this as one style of use of a platform which supports

   application mobility, server reselection in response to user mobility

   the impact of nomadicity on client server interaction; how to support

   question of whether the computational viewpoint client server
   interaction mechanisms for feed environments remain valid in mobile

   aspect of dealing with mobile routing and the unpredictable

Compared to wired networks, which have developed rapidly,

A technology has been developed that can enable
   considerable improvements in remote sensing by replacing the wire
   data paths with RF links. The technology must be small and yet
   powerful enough to gather data at speeds that are dictated by
   applications. These speeds could range from sample rates of a few
   hertz (large structural vibration analysis) to many mega-samples per
   second needed for acoustic emission analysis. The RF channels must
   not interfere with existing electronics; conversely, the network must
   be able to operate without interference from existing electronics. To
   accomplish this, a radio technique called spread spectrum is used.
   Various implementations of the technology can be used to satisfy
   various applications. The system concept is based on the premise that
   many applications exist that demand data collection from
   geographically dispersed locations. Moreover, the data must be
   provided with an accurate estimate of exact phase relationships
   between data points. This preservation of phase enables conventional
   and experimental mathematical techniques to be used to define
   relationships between data points and explain the technical
   significance of the relationship. Initial applications of the
   technology involving conventional earth structures such as vehicular
   bridges as well as space vehicles have proved the operational and
   economic feasibility of wireless remote sensing. The utility of RF
   instead of wire is further enhanced by a proprietary set of network
   control algorithms that provide a dynamically reconfigurable network

This paper discusses extensions to the Rover toolkit for constructing 
reliable mobile-aware applications.  The extensions improve upon the existing failure 
model, which addresses client or communication failures and guarantees reliable 
message delivery from clients to server, but does not address server failures (e.g., 
the loss of an incoming message due to server failure) (Joseph et al., 1997).  Due to 
the unpredictable, intermittent communication connectivity typically found in mobile 
client environments, it is inappropriate to make clients responsible for guaranteeing 
request completion at servers.  The extensions discussed in this paper provide both 
system- and language-level support for reliable operation in the form of stable 
logging of each message received by a server, per-application stable variables, 
programmer-supplied failure recovery procedures, server process failure detection, 
and automatic server process restart.  The design and implementation of fault-
tolerance support is optimized for high performance in the normal case (network 
connectivity provided by a high latency, low bandwidth, wireless link): measurements 
show a best-case overhead of less than 7% for a reliable null RPC over wired and 
cellular dialup links.  Experimental results from both micro-benchmarks and 
applications, such as the Rover Web Browser proxy, show that support for reliable 
operation can be provided at an overhead of only a few percent of execution time 
during normal operation. ",

The software and protocols associated with information browsing systems 
are largely designed with static access points and wired networks in mind, HTTP and 
the Web are a case in point.  Static hosts are connected to wired, high bandwidth 
networks, and are capable of transmitting and receiving large amounts of data without 
significant delays.  As such, the size and format of the data files being received by 
the browser/client has never been a concern.  However, this causes problems when 
information access is desired on mobile hosts (MH), since data transmission over a 
wireless network is much slower than on a wired network.  Mobile computers are also 
relatively resource-poor, compared to their desktop counterparts.  This fact is 
ignored by HTTP servers, and large data files are transmitted to computers that 
cannot properly display them.  Also, mobile computers operate in constantly changing 
network environments.  It is possible for a mobile computer to become temporarily 
disconnected from a network when it changes base stations or goes out of range of a 
base station.  A mobile host may also doze off to preserve battery power and thus be 
disconnected.  The information browsing system and protocols associated with mobile

work focuses on addressing these problems in the context of web browsing from a 
mobile host.  The current model of Web browsing is inherently sequential, and

Wireless networks are characterized by simple end devices and limited

mobile environment that has been widely pursued is the placement of proxies, or 
agents, inside the network to assist with application processing that would normally 
take place on end devices.  These agents can additionally manipulate data to reduce 
bandwidth requirements and assist in providing services.  The design and 
implementation of a user agent is heavily impacted by the application it supports.  
In this paper we present our experiences with user agents in two different types of 
applications: telephony-based Personal Communication Services (PCS) and two-way 
messaging.  To provide low latency service, the PCS user agents are mobile so that 
they may be kept close to their end devices.  The design of the PCS agents limits 
migration overhead to the transfer of approximately 100 bytes of information in about 
150 milliseconds.  To provide advanced messaging services, the messaging user agent 
supports flexible messages while limiting air interface bandwidth usage.  The 
messaging agents reduce uplink bandwidth usage by approximately 35% when applied to a

The increasing deployment of wireless access technology, along with the 
emergence of high speed integrated service networks, such as ATM, promises to provide 
mobile users with ubiquitous access to multimedia information in the near future.  
One of the key problems in building connection-oriented ATM networks that support 
host mobility is designing mechanisms for rerouting virtual circuits to maintain data 
flow to and from mobile hosts.  Ideally, VC rerouting must be done fast enough so as 
to cause minimal disruption to applications while minimizing the signaling overhead.  
In this paper, we evaluate the impact of several virtual circuit rerouting strategies 
on application performance.  We initially identify the primitive operations required 
by any rerouting policy and use this to analytically quantify the cost of each 
rerouting policy in terms of wireless link disruption as a function of various 
network parameters.  We then evaluate the effect of the VC rerouting policy on 
application-level performance using simulations.  Our results show that the effect of

There has been a rapid growth in several segments of
   wireless personal communications in recent years. One of the
   potential applications of wireless communications is to support
   multimedia applications on a broadband ATM platform. In such a
   system, remote terminals may be capable of producing broadband
   real-time traffic such as variable bit-rate video or bursty
   instantaneous file transfers. In this thesis, wt describe a broadband
   indoor wireless system, where the base stations are connected through
   an ATM network. The ATM switch provides backbone connectivity among
   microcells as well as with the outside world. We investigate a
   broadband indoor wireless network (BIWN) employing time division
   multiple access (TDMA), based on polling, for dynamic bandwidth
   allocation. This thesis work aims at evaluating the performance of an
   indoor wireless network supporting high speed bursty traffic using a
   developed, simplified simulation approach. The results have been
   obtained through simulations which involve modeling the indoor radio
   channel behaviour, traffic heterogeneity and implementing an
   efficient bandwidth management procedure. The performance of the BIWN
   as seen by a given user terminal has been simulated.",

Digital video coding exploits redundancy both within and
   between images to achieve the high levels of compression required to
   support video transmission over dedicated wired links. Video
   protocols that operate over packet networks like the Internet must
   additionally take into account the potential for congestion-based
   packet losses, high latency, and variable bandwidth. Wireless video
   protocols must contend with even higher packet loss due to
   uncorrelated phenomena. Unfortunately, these channel characteristics
   interfere with typical codecs, exacerbating the challenge of
   maintaining frame rate during periods of moderate packet loss. New
   codecs that mitigate packet loss by organizing intraframe data in
   progressive or layered representations are needed for robust wireless
   video transport; additional compression gains alone are unlikely to
   provide robustness when packets are lost or corrupted. In addition,
   new network protocols that allow corrupted packets to reach video
   applications are required to significantly improve codec robustness
   beyond current levels. A new metric which evaluates video codestreams
   on their ability to withstand packet errors is developed and applied
   to several image transformations, including the DCT and DPCM. Use of
   the metric suggests a new video codec that is less susceptible to
   corruption than conventional techniques. Implementation and testing
   of this Slug Video codec provides further evidence that current
   network protocols are inadequate to the task of supporting robust
   video transmission over lossy packet networks.

The paper describes Ethersin, a simulation tool to model and study the

  Ethersim has a discrete event based simulator core and incorporates models
  of user applications and transport, network and MAC layer protocols. It
  provides the capability to specify a cellular wireless ATM network
  topology and host mobility patterns. The software architecture of Ethersim
  employs five special entities: an air module, a map, a mover, mobile
  hosts, and basestations. We also present case-studies of using Ethersim to

The wireless communications industry has shown explosive growth in the
  recent past. At the same time, new information access technologies for the
  Internet have gained universal acceptance. In the wireless market, single
  mobile switching center analog systems have rapidly evolved into hybrid
  networks with time division multiple access and code division multiple
  access technologies. These developments have created a need for a
  comprehensive network performance management tool to measure and analyze
  capacity, growth, and performance of wireless networks. This need is being
  addressed by the state-of-the-art Systems Measurement Analysis and
  Reporting Tool (SMART), which is based on Internet access technology.
  SMART is being developed as one of the first Web-based tools on the
  Autoplex(R) 1000 product line and is designed to run on the operations and
  maintenance platform (OMP) in a client-server architecture, with the OMP
  acting as a network management server. SMART has extensive applications in
  making performance, capacity, and engineering-related decisions that are
  relevant during wireless systems planning, design, and operation. This
  paper describes the SMART architecture, its implementation on the Autoplex
  system, and applications in managing the capacity, growth, and performance
  of a wireless network. Though some features of SMART discussed here have
  been developed, SMART must not be construed as an openly available and

This paper addresses the choices that need to be made in
   the design of a quality of service (QoS) framework for mobile and
   wireless networks. An uncontrollably time varying environment,
   arising due to physical processes such as fading as well as
   systematic processes such as handoffs, is an inalienable
   characteristic of these networks. Therefore, the laissez faire model
   of purely reactive applications adapting to a black-box network does
   not work well for multimedia applications in the presence of wireless
   and mobility. However, as we empirically show, the other extreme of
   applying rigid quality of service models borrowed from the wired
   networks, with correspondingly complex network mechanisms, is also a
   bad idea because of the often adverse interaction between higher
   layer protocols with mechanisms such as rerouting and MAC control. We
   advocate that mobile network and wireless link layer mechanisms
   should be kept simple and stupid, though not oblivious of QoS, and
   that applications should be made more sophisticated with QoS
   renegotiation and adaptation capabilities. The paper describes the
   necessary support required in various layers of mobile wireless
   networks, and advocates specific solutions based on empirical
   validations. ",
