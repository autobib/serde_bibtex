                  ground for researchers from the XML,
                  programming language, and database communities.
                  XML is already a de-facto industry standard for
                  data exchange, it has from an early stage been
                  embraced by database researchers, and it is
                  gaining increasing interest from programming
                  language researchers.\bibpar
                  At this workshop we hope to present recent
                  results, identify new challenges, and inspire
                  the programming language community to focus on
                  XML.\bibpar
                  The focus of the workshop is on methods, tools,
                  and theories for processing XML. Example topics
                  include (but are not limited to) XML parsing,
                  XML type system and schemas, analysis and
                  implementation of technologies such as XPath,
                  XSLT, and XQuery, and integration of XML in
                  both general-purpose and domain-specific
