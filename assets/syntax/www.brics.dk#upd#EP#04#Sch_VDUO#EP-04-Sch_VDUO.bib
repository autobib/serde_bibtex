  abstract = 	 "This paper presents the notion of virtual
                  distances -- communication proximity -- to
                  describe the quality of a connection between
                  two devices. We use virtual distances as the
                  basis of optimizations performed by a virtual
                  machine where a part of an application can be
                  moved to another device if this gives a
                  performance improvement. As best-effort
                  connections are used the quality of service
                  cannot be negotiated, but the virtual distances
                  are monitored by the virtual machine. The
                  information gained by monitoring is employed to
                  optimize the use of resources in applications
                  on mobile devices, by taking advantage of
                  temporarily available resources at the current
                  local area network or through ad-hoc
                  networks."
