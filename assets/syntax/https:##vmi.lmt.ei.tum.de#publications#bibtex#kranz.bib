	context for children. The first system is the BlueCube, a wirelessly
	networked tangible computer using acceleration sensors built into
	a cube, the second is a modern mobile phone with Bluetooth capabilities
	and J2ME support. Both devices use different input modalities for
	the same task: a supportive and general learning platform. We present
	the hardware platform built for the BlueCube and the system architecture.
	The goal of this work is to compare the impacts of both systems on
	the experience and learning success. We conclude by giving an outlook

	The focus of the research is on embedding information into people's

	not annoying is still a challenge. Observing mobile phone information

	users - exactly when and where it is needed. Our approach is based
	on a variety of information displays unobtrusively embedded into
	the user's everyday environment. We place the information displays
	in context. In contrast to the traditional approach on context-awareness
	where a context is recognized and then the appropriate information
	is delivered, we look at providing information already in context.
