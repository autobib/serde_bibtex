                 sources and camera at infinity is less than with light
                 sources at finite distance from the illuminated
                 surface. On the other hand, in the case of an
                 infinitely remote light source and camera, planar
                 polygons don't receive highlights. In this paper, a
                 method is suggested to use the (relatively cheap)
                 infinite-distance model instead of the expensive
                 finite-distance model for the computation of
                 highlights. It works by replacing a light source at
                 finite distance by a light source at infinite distance,
                 and at the same time adjusting the normal vectors in
                 such a way that the resulting illumination pattern
                 stays the same. With these modifications, a simple
                 table look-up comes in the place of an expensive
                 computation to obtain the specular term in the standard
                 illumination model.",

                 moments and products of inertia about various axes are
                 important physical quantities needed for any type of
                 dynamic simulation or physically based modeling. We
                 present an algorithm for automatically computing these
                 quantities for a general class of rigid bodies: those
                 composed of uniform density polyhedra. The mass
                 integrals may be converted into volume integrals under
                 these assumptions, and the bulk of the paper is devoted
                 to the computation of these volume integrals. Our
                 algorithm is based on a three step reduction of the
                 volume integrals to successively simpler integrals. The
                 algorithm is designed to minimize the numerical errors
                 that can result from poorly conditioned alignment of

                 views, each view created by point-sampling of the

                 ray-traceable form) from different views. The algorithm
                 consists of two parts: construction and simplification.
                 The construction method is based on the Delaunay
                 tetrahedralization of points in three dimensions and
                 uses the half-space constraints imposed by the

                 well a set of spheres is approximated by a single

                 illumination technique that usually involves the
                 discretization of the environment being modeled and
                 estimating the light transported between the resulting
                 elements. The computed result, a collection of patches
                 and their estimated radiances, does not produce a very
                 realistic image and often the reconstruction of the
                 illuminance functions over each visible surface is
                 necessary. The more sophisticated of these
                 reconstruction techniques perform a local gathering
                 step at closely spaced sample points, typically one per
                 pixel. This paper describes an algorithmic framework
                 for implementing this final gathering pass that allows
                 one to adaptively control the spacing of sample points
                 in order to minimize the number of computationally
                 expensive local gather operations while still achieving
                 a rendered image of acceptable quality.\par The basic
                 algorithm is independent of the method by which the
                 global illumination solution is obtained but can easily
                 be tuned for specific models and surfaces. The method
                 is also easily extended to allow the shading of curved

                 representation using axis-aligned bounding boxes
                 (AABBs). Recent work has shown that AABB trees are
                 slower than oriented bounding box (OBB) trees for
                 performing overlap tests. In this paper, we describe a

                 for collision detection of rigid models, the difference

                 in computer graphics, with skin, textiles, and soft

                 system of vertices and edges, possibly with highly
                 irregular geometry, in which each edge is a spring, and
                 springs are connected by ``pin-joints''
                 (``gimbal-joints'' in three dimensions) at the
                 vertices. This method is computationally attractive,
                 compared to some alternatives. Given a specified set of
                 elastic material properties, however, the question of
                 whether a particular spring mesh accurately simulates
                 those properties has been largely ignored in the

                 squared. Its accuracy is demonstrated on test and

                 is difficult to do well. Many graphics applications
                 demand that we be able to compute and differentiate
                 positions and orientations of articulated figures with
                 respect to their rotational (and other) parameters, as
                 well as integrate differential equations, optimize
                 rotation parameters, and interpolate orientations.
                 Widely used parameterizations such as Euler angles and
                 quaternions are well suited to only a few of these
                 operations. The exponential map maps a vector in $R^3$
                 describing the axis and magnitude of a three-DOF
                 rotation to the corresponding rotation. Several
                 graphics researchers have applied it with limited
                 success to interpolation of orientations, but it has
                 been virtually ignored with respect to the other
                 operations mentioned above. In this paper we present
                 formulae for computing, differentiating, and
                 integrating three-DOF rotations with the exponential
                 map. We show that our formulation is numerically stable
                 in the face of machine precision issues, and that for
                 most applications all singularities in the map can be
                 avoided through a simple technique of dynamic
                 reparameterization. We demonstrate how to use the
                 exponential map to solve both the ``freely rotating
                 body'' problem and the important ball-and-socket joint
                 required to accurately model shoulder and hip joints in
                 articulated figures. Examining several common graphics
                 applications, we explain the benefits of our
                 formulation of the exponential map over Euler angles
                 and quaternions, including robustness, small state
                 vectors, lack of explicit constraints, good modeling

                 tool to model deformable objects. Their shapes can be
                 easily modified by moving the control points. A common
                 method used to render these objects is polygonization.
                 However, the polygonization process is computationally
                 very expensive. If the object deforms, we need to
                 execute this process in every frame to reflect the

                 from biomechanics. A reach cone is specified as a
                 spherical polygon on the surface of a reach sphere that
                 defines all positions the longitudinal segment axis
                 beyond the joint can take. Reach polygons can be
                 concave or convex, and cover more than one hemisphere.
                 Longitudinal axis rotation limits can also be defined
                 for locations in the reach cone. Calculations to
                 determine whether a segment is within the reach cone
                 are based on the relation of the segment longitudinal
                 axis to the planes defining the reach cone and are done
                 in the local coordinate space of the segment. The

                 that contain incompressible rotational structures and
                 dynamically react to user-supplied forces. Specialized
                 for a fluid which wraps around in space, it allows us
                 to take advantage of the Fourier transform, which
                 greatly simplifies many aspects of the solver. Indeed,
                 given a Fast Fourier Transform, our solver can be
                 implemented in roughly one page of readable C code. The
                 solver is a good starting point for anyone interested
                 in coding a basic fluid solver. The fluid solver

                 the distribution of densities and colors inside the
                 gas. A multi-pass algorithm for real-time rendering of
                 a gas defined by a three-dimensional boundary is
                 presented. The density and the color of the gas inside
                 the boundary may be constant, or the color of a dense
                 gas can be defined by a texture. This algorithm is
                 combined with an existing algorithm for rendering
                 layered fog so that the density and color inside the
                 three-dimensional boundary can vary along a single

                 is generated using a popular method based on triangle
                 subdivision. In applications, each data point (for
                 example, representing a direction from a point on a
                 surface) is typically associated with additional
                 information (for example, a radiance value). Given an
                 arbitrary query point on the hemisphere we require the
                 nearest data point from the given distribution. An
                 algorithm is presented that finds the data point in
                 constant time, independently of the number of original
                 points in the distribution. A portion of the hemisphere
                 is rendered such that each point in the distribution
                 has an associated set of quadrilaterals rendered with a
                 unique color index for that point. The frame-buffer for
                 the rendered hemisphere portion can be stored in
                 off-screen memory. Any query point can be projected
                 into this off-screen frame buffer, projected to a
                 'pixel' location, and the color index stored at this
                 pixel location found. This color index is a lookup into
                 an array of the original data points. This algorithm is

                 More precisely, {\em incremental visualization\/} is
                 defined as the possibility for the programmer to
                 visualize interactively any significant update of the
                 geometric data structures at any time. {\em
                 Non-intrusive debugging\/} is defined as the
                 possibility of visualizing any geometric entity in
                 three dimensions from a standard debugger at any time
                 without modifying the source code. We present a setup
                 to perform incremental visualization and non-intrusive

                 mapped meshes is a very efficient method for real-time

                 In this paper, we present a new and fast normal map
                 construction algorithm. We scan-convert each triangle
                 of the simplified model, which results in a regularly
                 spaced point set on the surface of each triangle. The
                 original model and all these point samples of the
                 simplified model are rendered from uniformly
                 distributed camera positions. The actual normal map was
                 created by computing the corresponding normals for the
                 point sets. For each point, the normal of the closest
                 point from the high resolution mesh over the set of all
                 camera positions is chosen. Our approach works for
                 general triangle meshes and exploits fully common
                 graphics rendering hardware. Normal map construction
                 times are generally in the range of only a few seconds
                 even for large models. We render our normal-mapped
                 meshes in real-time with a slightly modified version of
                 the standard bump-mapping algorithm. In order to
                 evaluate the approximation error, we investigate the
                 distance and normal errors for normal-mapped meshes.
                 Our investigation of the approximation errors shows
                 that using more than 12 viewpoints does not result in a
                 further improvement in the normal maps for our test

                 Instead of doing the optimization in 3D space to find a
                 good view frustum, our method uses a 2D approach. The

                 2D bounding quadrilateral is then computed to enclose
                 these 2D image points. Next, considering the projective
                 warp between the bounding quadrilateral and the
                 rectangular viewing region, our method applies a
                 technique of camera calibration to compute a new view
                 frustum that generates an image that covers the viewing
                 region as much as possible.",

                 still use it. However, this look-up table can lead to

                 a full implementation of Chernyaev's technique to
                 ensure a topologically correct result, i.e., a manifold
                 mesh, for any input data. It completes the original

                 feasibility of the implementation. Moreover, the cube
                 interpolation provided here can be used in a wider
                 range of methods. The source code is available

                 graphics such as non-photorealistic edge rendering, fur
                 rendering, shadow volume creation, and anti-aliasing.
                 The number of edges, $s$, in the silhouette of a model
                 observed from a point is therefore useful in analyzing
                 such algorithms. \par

                 This paper examines, from a theoretical viewpoint, a
                 menagerie of objects with interesting silhouettes
                 (including those with minimal and maximal silhouettes).
                 It shows that the relationship between and $s$ and the
                 number of triangles in a model, $f$, is bounded above
                 by $s = O(f)$ and below by $s = \Omega(1)$, and that
                 the expected value of $s$ over all observation points
                 at infinity is proportional to the sum of the dihedral
                 angles. \par

                 In practice, the models used with silhouette-based
                 rendering algorithms are triangle meshes that are
                 manually constructed or result from scans of human-made
                 objects. They consist of only surface geometry with few
                 cracks; there is no internal detail like the engine
                 under a car's hood. Geometric and aesthetic constraints
                 on these models appear to create an inherent
                 relationship between $f$ and $s$. Measurements of the

                 it works for both polar and concentric maps between a
                 square and an ellipse. The mapping preserves adjacency
                 and fractional area, and does not require any numerical

                 map demonstrates better performance. Our technique has
                 proven useful in realistic image synthesis using Monte

                 evaluated through comparisons with real measured data.
                 As the demand for plausible and predictable scattering
                 models increases, more attention is given to performing
                 such comparisons. In this paper we examine the
                 implementation of virtual goniphotometers used to
                 obtain BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution
                 function) and BTDF (bidirectional transmittance
                 distribution function) records from algorithmic
                 scattering models. These records can be compared to
                 data from actual experiments in order to validate the
                 models. Our discussion focuses on practical issues,
                 namely the subdivision of the devices' collector sphere
                 and the ray density required to obtain reliable BRDF
                 and BTDF estimates. The subdivision techniques examined
                 in this paper have been used before in publications,
                 but the details of their computation are not readily
                 available in the literature. Although the mathematical
                 bound presented to determine appropriate ray densities
                 for virtual goniphotometers is a direct generalization
                 of a bound used for virtual spectrophotometers, it has
                 not been published before. Our discussion of these
