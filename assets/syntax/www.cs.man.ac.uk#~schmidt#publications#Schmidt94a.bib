ABSTRACT = {In [1] we present a two-sorted algebra, called a {\em Peirce
algebra}, of relations and sets interacting with each other.  In a
Peirce algebra, sets can combine with each other as in a Boolean
algebra, relations can combine with each other as in a relation algebra,
and in addition we have both a set-forming operator on relations (the
Peirce product of Boolean modules) and a relation-forming operator on
sets (a cylindrification operation).  Peirce algebras provide useful
formalisations for various fields in Computer Science.   In this talk I
focus on the application of Peirce algebras in artificial intelligence
and computational intelligence.  In particular, I show that the
so-called {\em terminological logics} arising in knowledge
representation (originating with a system called {\sc kl-one}) have
evolved a semantics best described as a calculus of relations
interacting with sets [1,2,3].  In computational linguistics P. Suppes
(1976,1979,1981) and M. B\"ottner (1992) use concrete Peirce algebras as
a relational formalisation of the semantics of the English language.  In
[4] I link both these applications and show that Peirce algebra provides
a useful bridge for utilising the linguistic investigations for the
problem of finding adequate terminological representations for given
information formulated in ordinary English.
