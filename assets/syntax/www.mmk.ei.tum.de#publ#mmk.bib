	Bjoern Schuller (Inst. for Human-Machine Commun.,
	
	 Technische Universitaet Muenchen, D-80333 Muenchen, Germany, schuller@tum.de)
	
	
	Researchers concerned with automatic recognition of human emotion
	in speech have proposed a considerable variety of segmental
	
	and supra-segmental acoustic descriptors. These range from prosodic
	characteristics to voice quality to acoustic correlates of articulation
	
	and represent unequal degrees of perceptual elaboration. Recently,
	evidence has been reported from first comparisons on multiple
	
	speech databases that spectral and cepstral characteristics have the
	greatest potential for the task [B. Schuller et al., Linguistic
	Insights 97, 285–307 (2009)]. 
	
	Yet, novel acoustic correlates are constantly proposed, as the question
	of the optimal representation remains
	
	disputed. The task of evaluating suggested correlates is non-trivial,
	as no agreed “standard” set and method of assessment exists, and
	
	inter-corpus substantiation is usually lacking. Such substantiation
	is particularly difficult owing to the divergence of models employed
	
	for the ground-truth description of emotion. To ease this challenge,
	using the potency-arousal-valence space as the predominant means
	
	for mapping information stemming from diverse speech resources, including
	acted and spontaneous speech with variable and fixed
	
	phonetic content on well-defined binary tasks is proposed. Among the
	various options for automatic classification, a method combining
	
	static and dynamic features representing pitch, intensity, duration,
	voice quality, and cepstral attributes is recommended.},
