  abstract = {Data sets coming from simulations or sampling of real-world phenomena
              often contain noise that hinders their processing and analysis. Automatic
              filtering and denoising can be challenging: when the nature of the
              noise is unknown, it is difficult to distinguish between noise and
              actual data features; in addition, the filtering process itself may
              introduce artificial features into the data set that were not originally
              present. In this paper, we propose a smoothing method for 2D scalar
              fields that gives the user explicit control over the data features.
              We define features as critical points of the given scalar function,
              and the topological structure they induce (i.e., the Morse-Smale
              complex). Feature significance is rated according to topological
              persistence. Our method allows filtering out spurious features that
              arise due to noise by means of topological simplification, providing
              the user with a simple interface that defines the significance threshold,
              coupled with immediate visual feedback of the remaining data features.
              In contrast to previous work, our smoothing method guarantees a C1-continuous
              output scalar field with the exact specified features and topological
              structures.},
