      Web Usage Mining (WUM) usually considers server logs as a data
        source for collecting patterns of usage data.  This
        solution presents limitations when the goal is to
        represent how users interact with specific user
        interface elements, since this approach may not have
        detailed information about what the users do in a
        Web page.  This technical report presents a model
        for logging client-side events and an implementation
        of it in a tool called WELFIT (Web Event Logger and
        Flow Identification Tool).  By using the model
        presented here miner systems can capture more
        detailed Web usage data, making possible a more
        fine-grained examination of Web pages usage.  In
        addition, the model can help HCI (Human-Computer
        Interaction) practitioners to log client-side events
        of mobile devices, set-top boxes, Web pages, among
        other artifacts.
