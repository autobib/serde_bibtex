@article{Arrows,
  abstract =	 {Monads are by now well-established as programming
                  construct in functional languages. Recently, the
                  notion of Arrow was introduced by Hughes as an
                  extension, not with one, but with two type
                  parameters. At first, these Arrows may look somewhat
                  arbitrary. Here we show that they are categorically
                  fairly civilised, by showing that they correspond to
                  monoids in suitable subcategories of bifunctors
                  . This shows that, at a suitable level of
                  abstraction, arrows are like monads -- which are
                  monoids in categories of functors .Freyd categories
                  have been introduced by Power and Robinson to model
                  computational effects, well before Hughes' Arrows
                  appeared. It is often claimed (informally) that
                  Arrows are simply Freyd categories. We shall make
                  this claim precise by showing how monoids in
                  categories of bifunctors exactly correspond to Freyd
                  categories.},

                  categories are introduced. An operation of
                  substitution for generalised species, which is the
                  counterpart to the composition of generalised
                  analytic functors, is also put forward. These
                  definitions encompass most notions of combinatorial
                  species considered in the literature -- including of
                  course Joyal's original notion -- together with
                  their associated substitution operation. Our first
                  main result exhibits the substitution calculus of
                  generalised species as arising from a Kleisli
                  bicategory for a pseudo-comonad on profunctors. Our

  abstract =	 {We propose a novel, comonadic approach to dataflow
                  (stream-based) computation. This is based on the
                  observation that both general and causal stream
                  functions can be characterized as coKleisli arrows
                  of comonads and on the intuition that comonads in
                  general must be a good means to structure
                  context-dependent computation. In particular, we
                  develop a generic comonadic interpreter of languages
                  for context-dependent computation and instantiate it
                  for stream-based computation. We also discuss
                  distributive laws of a comonad over a monad as a
                  means to structure combinations of effectful and
                  context-dependent computation. We apply the latter
                  to analyse clocked dataflow (partial streams based)
                  computation.},
