  Abstract =     "We believe the techniques for evaluating clone
                  detectors can be improved, and that the improvements
                  can lead the way to better clone detector research
                  and research results. Current techniques are based
                  on simple performance measures borrowed from
                  information retrieval (IR) research. Here we argue
                  that additional IR evaluation measures can be
                  usefully imported.",
