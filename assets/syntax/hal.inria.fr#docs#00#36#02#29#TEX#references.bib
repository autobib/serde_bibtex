	abstract = {{This monograph presents an approach to complexity theory which offers a means of analysing algorithms in terms of their tractability. The authors consider the problem in terms of parameterized languages and taking "k-slices" of the language. In doing so, the reader is introduced to new classes of algorithms which may be analysed more precisely than hereto. The authors have made the book as self-contained as possible and a lot of background material is included. As a result, computer scientists, mathematicians, and graduate students interested in the design and analysis of algorithms will find much of interest in this book.}},

  abstract = {Parameterized complexity theory is a recent branch of computational
	complexity theory that provides a framework for a refined analysis
	of hard algorithmic problems. The central notion of the theory, fixed-parameter
	tractability, has led to the development of various new algorithmic
	techniques and a whole new theory of intractability.
	
	This book is a state-of-the-art introduction to both algorithmic techniques
	for fixed-parameter tractability and the structural theory of parameterized
	complexity classes, and it presents detailed proofs of recent advanced
	results that have not appeared in book form before. Several chapters
	are each devoted to intractability, algorithmic techniques for designing
	fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and bounded fixed-parameter
	tractability and subexponential time complexity. The treatment is
	comprehensive, and the reader is supported with exercises, notes,
	a detailed index, and some background on complexity theory and logic.
	
	The book will be of interest to computer scientists, mathematicians
	and graduate students engaged with algorithms and problem complexity.},
