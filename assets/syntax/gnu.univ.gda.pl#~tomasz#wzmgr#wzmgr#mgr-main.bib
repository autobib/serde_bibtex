		  SPIR addendum (Straub 1994) by adding gender to an IT
		  diffusion model. The technology acceptance model (TAM) has
		  been widely studied in IS research as an explanation of the
		  use of in formation systems across IS types and
		  nationalities. While this line of research has found
		  significant cross-cultural differences, it has ignored the
		  effects of gender, even though in socio-linguistic
		  research, gender is a fundamental aspect of culture.
		  Indeed, socio-linguistic research has shown that men tend
		  to locus discourse on hierarchy and independence, while
		  women focus on intimacy and solidarity. This literature
		  provides a solid grounding for conceptual extensions to the
		  IT diffusion research and the technology acceptance model.
		  Testing gender differences that might relate to ballets and
		  use of computer-based media, this study sampled 392 female
		  and male responses via a cross-sectional survey instrument.
		  The sample drew from comparable groups of knowledge workers
		  using e-mail systems in the airline industry in North
		  America, Asia, and Europe. Study findings indicate that
		  women and men differ in their perceptions but not use of
		  e-male. These findings suggest that researchers should
		  include gender in IT diffusion models along with other
		  cultural effects. Managers and co-workers, moreover, need
		  to realize that the same mode of communication may be
		  perceived differently by the sexes, suggesting that more
		  favorable communications environments might be created,
		  environments that take into account not only organizational
		  contextual factors, but also the gender of users. The
		  creation of these environments involves not only the actual
		  deployment of communication media, but also organizational
		  training on communications media. ",

		  -- The dominant focus in empirical investigations of the
		  TAM has been on modelling intention for its effect on
		  self-reported usage behaviour, while the attitudinal
		  construct has been neglected. This raises three questions:
		  whether the exclusion of attitude from the TAM is
		  beneficial for understanding of technology usage behaviour
		  in mandatory settings; whether the revised TAM holds
		  equally for mandatory and voluntary settings; and whether
		  the emphasis on measuring intentions and self-report use
		  rather than actual usage is warranted. An additional
		  question answered in the meta-analysis is about the
		  relative importance of PU and PEOU. Originality/value --

		  acceptance, estimates of its structural weights are not

		  742 users of office suite applications (i.e., spreadsheet,

		  illustrated the use of multi-group analysis of structural
