title={Tone Mapping for High Dynamic Range Imaging},
school={Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol},
bpages={210},
rpages={12},
month={June},
year={2005},
abstract={We live in a world of high contrast environments that we cannot directly reproduce on typical
display technologies. From bright features to dark shadows, natural scenes are filled with contrasts
measured in ratios of thousands or more to one. Unfortunately, displays are only capable of
linearly displaying ranges of tens to one. How can we reduce the high dynamic ranges of a
scene sufficiently for display yet still preserve the small contrast features important for visibility?
Humans achieve this by a local adaptation processes which allows different photoreceptors in the
eye to adjust to different luminance levels.
In this thesis, a new method of contrast reduction is proposed. Taking example from humans,
this model is based on the eyeýs response to light reaching the retina which simulates the highly
localised process of visibility. An extension to the operator is then proposed which simulates eye
adaptation as a function of time. Our adaptation model, is based on widely accepted psychophysical
data.
Although several tone mapping operators have been published in recent years, a formal evaluation
of the accuracy of these algorithms has yet to be conducted. In this work, we propose a methodology
and results of an evaluation of our algorithm and other published techniques comparing their
output with images displayed on a novel high dynamic range display. This prototype is unique
and allowed us to observe for the first time displayed high contrast scenes. We believe that this
research will be useful for the Computer Graphics community and lay the foundation for improved
tone mapping algorithms for typical displays and in the future, for high dynamic range ones.},

  abstract = {The ultimate aim of realistic graphics is the creation of
    images that provoke the same responses that a viewer would have to a
	real scene. This STAR addresses two related key problem areas in this
	effort which are located at opposite ends of the rendering pipeline,
	namely the data structures used to describe light during the actual
	rendering process, and the issue of displaying such radiant intensities
	in a meaningful way.
    The interest in the first of these subproblems stems from the fact that
	it is common industry practice to use RGB colour values to describe light
	intensity and surface reflectancy. While viable in the context of methods
	that do not strive to achieve true realism, this approach has to be
	replaced by more physically accurate techniques if a prediction of nature
	is intended.
    The second subproblem is that while research into ways of rendering
	images provides us with better and faster methods, we do not necessarily
	see their full effect due to limitations of the display hardware. The low
	dynamic range of a standard computer monitor requires some form of mapping
	to produce images that are perceptually accurate. Tone reproduction
	operators attempt to replicate the effect of real-world luminance
	intensities. This STAR report will review the work to date on spectral
	rendering and tone reproduction techniques. It will include an
	investigation into the need for spectral imagery synthesis methods and
	accurate tone reproduction, and a discussion of major approaches to
	physically correct rendering and key tone mapping algorithms. The future
	of both spectral rendering and tone reproduction techniques will be
	considered, together with the implications of advances in display hardware.},

  abstract = { Modern graphics architectures have replaced stages of the
    graphics pipeline with fully programmable modules.
    Therefore, it is now possible to perform fairly general computation
    on each vertex or fragment in a scene.
    In addition, the nature of the graphics pipeline makes substantial
    computational power available if the programs have a suitable
    structure.
    In this paper, we show that it is possible to cleanly map a state-of-
    the-art tone mapping algorithm to the pixel processor.
    This allows an interactive application to achieve higher levels of
    realism by rendering with physically based, unclamped lighting values
    and high dynamic range texture maps.
    We also show that the tone mapping operator can easily be extended to
    include a time-dependent model, which is crucial for interactive
    behavior.
    Finally, we describe the ways in which the graphics hardware limits
    our ability to compress dynamic range efficiently, and discuss
    modifications to the algorithm that could alleviate these problems.},
