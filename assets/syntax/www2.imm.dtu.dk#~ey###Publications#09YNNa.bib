abstract = {ZigBee is a wireless sensor network standard that
defines network and application layers on top of IEEE 802.15.4's
physical and medium access control layers. In the latest version
of ZigBee, enhancements are prescribed for the security sublayer
but we show in this paper that problems persist. In particular
we show that the End-to-End Application Key Establishment
Protocol is flawed and we propose a secure protocol instead. We
do so by using formal verification techniques based on static
program analysis and process algebras. We present a way of
using formal methods in wireless network security, and propose
a secure key establishment protocol for ZigBee networks.},
