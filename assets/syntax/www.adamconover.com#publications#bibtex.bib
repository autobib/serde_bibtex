    abstract = "This paper explores a simulation of ``temporally autonomous'' agents which concurrently interact via exchange of simple ``belief'' messages in a spatially embedded grid.  By ``temporally autonomous'', we mean that the agents are free to communally interact in a manner which is decoupled from any form of global coordination or synchronization.  In this simulation, agents exchange small messages which are representative of a given agent's active ``belief'' state.  These belief states are communicated in an attempt to alter (or sustain) the belief states of neighboring agents.  However, over the course of the simulation, the timing variability of agent interaction is adjusted, which produces global variations in the emergent behavior the population.  It will be shown that the degree of timing variability strongly correlates to the survival rates of any given belief state.",
