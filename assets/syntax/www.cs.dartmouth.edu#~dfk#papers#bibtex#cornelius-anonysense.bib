    abstract = {Personal mobile devices are increasingly equipped with the
capability to sense the physical world (through cameras, microphones, and
accelerometers, for example) and the network world (with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
interfaces). Such devices offer many new opportunities for cooperative
sensing applications. For example, users' mobile phones may contribute data
to community-oriented information services, from city-wide pollution
monitoring to enterprise-wide detection of unauthorized Wi-Fi access points.
This people-centric mobile-sensing model introduces a new security challenge
in the design of mobile systems: protecting the privacy of participants while
allowing their devices to reliably contribute high-quality data to these
large-scale applications. \par We describe AnonySense, a privacy-aware
architecture for realizing pervasive applications based on collaborative,
opportunistic sensing by personal mobile devices. AnonySense allows
applications to submit sensing \emph{tasks\/} that will be distributed across
anonymous participating mobile devices, later receiving verified, yet
anonymized, sensor data \emph{reports\/} back from the field, thus providing
the first secure implementation of this participatory sensing model. We
describe our trust model, and the security properties that drove the design
of the AnonySense system. We evaluate our prototype implementation through
experiments that indicate the feasibility of this approach, and through two
applications: a Wi-Fi rogue access point detector and a lost-object finder.}
