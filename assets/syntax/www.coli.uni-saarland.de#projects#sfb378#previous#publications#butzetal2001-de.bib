We describe a hybrid building navigation system consisting of
stationary information booths and a mobile communication
infrastructure feeding small portable devices. The graphical
presentations for both the booths and the mobile devices are generated
from a common source and for the common task of way finding, but they
use different techniques to convey possibly different subsets of the
relevant information. The form of the presentations is depending on
technical limitations of the output media, accuracy of location
information, and cognitive restrictions of the user. We analyze what
information needs to be conveyed, how limited resources influence the
presentation of this information, and argue, that by generating all
different presentations in a common framework, a consistent appearance
across devices can be achieved and that the different device classes
can complement each other in facilitating the navigation task.
