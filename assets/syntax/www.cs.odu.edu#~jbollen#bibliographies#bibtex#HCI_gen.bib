abstract = {This research investigates how several characteristics of display-based systems support
or hinder the exploration and retention of the functions needed to perform tasks in a new
application. In particular it is shown how the combination of the type of interface
action, the number of interaction objects presented on the screen, and the quality of the
label associated with these objects interact in supporting discovery and retention of the
functionality embedded in those systems. An experiment is reported which provides
empirical evidence for Polson & Lewis's CE+ theory of exploratory learning of computer
systems [11]. It also extends this theory and therefore leads to a refinement of the
cognitive walkthrough procedure that was derived from it. The study uses an experimental
method that combines observations from realistically complex task scenarios with a
detailed analysis of the observed performance.},

      knowledge of a detailed representation of information on

      about the interface, and knowledge about the application
      domain to compute actions necessary to accomplish the

      account of one kind of errors, action slips [14], made by
      skilled users. We show how information about the

      critical role in skilled performance, i.e., display-based

                  wayfinding in the physical world can be applied to
                  construct aids for wayfinding in virtual worlds. An
                  experiment was conducted to determine whether people
                  use physical world wayfinding strategies in large virtual

                  complex searching task in a number of virtual worlds
                  with differing environmental cues. The results show
                  that subjects in the treatment without any
                  additional cues were often disoriented and had
                  extreme difficulty completing the task. In general,
                  subjects' wayfinding strategies and behaviors were
                  strongly influenced by the environmental cues in

     forming mental models of complex systems. Using a paradigm that elicits the subject's
     mental model of a system by the subject's reconfiguration of the display, the authors
     conducted four experiments that illustrate humans' ability and factors affecting their
     ability to detect correlation in a dynamic display. It is shown that subjects can detect
     correlation in a dynamic system and that lowering the correlation makes detecting the
     correlation progressively more difficult. The data, combined with the subjects' comments,
     shows that the strategies adopted by the subjects govern their ability to detect
     correlation. The strategies adopted depend on the degree of correlation and the type of
     movement. Correlation predisposed subjects to discover grouping by either pairwise
     comparison (in the case of low correlation) or global search (in the case of high
     correlation). The type of movement, on the other hand, predisposed subjects to group bars
     by height (in the case of random walk movement) or correlation (in the case of Gaussian
     mean zero movement). Generally, this study forms the beginning of a research program
     investigating the factors that guide operators in generating mental models of complex

                  under-utilizing the capabilities of computer

abstract = {This paper presents a new control method designed to improve vehicle
     drivability on downhill grades. Vehicles normally gain speed when travelling
     downhill even if the driver desires not to accelerate. Under such situation
     drivers often shift into a lower gear in order to reduce the vehicle speed.
     With the control method described here, the gear shifting operation is executed
     automatically by using a driver's mental model to infer the intention to
     decelerate. The driver's mental model is identified by applying the Interactive
     Dichotomizer 3 to obtain the inductive relationship between the vehicle
     operating data and the driver's intention. A study was made of the timing
     difference between the automated gear shifting and the manual gear shifting by
     the driver. The results of this study verify the effectiveness of the inference
     mechanism on the driver's intentions to control the power-train of the vehicle.},

abstract = { The notion of a `mental model' is widespread but ill defined. Its meaning can be
     clarified by noting both the cognitive processes of the worker and the context of the
     task. A mental model is a mapping of the properties of the task to its representation
     in the mind of the worker. Traditionally, such models have been identified by the use
     of protocol analysis, but a method has been developed which finds the mapping through
     its effects on the coupling between human and machine. This method uses Conant's
     theory of system decomposition based on high-order Shannon information theory. An
     example of its use is given.
     Relevance to industry
     Operators make use of mental models of complex systems in process control and
     manufacturing. A method to identify such models is relevant to productivity, and to
     fault detection and management, since it gives insight into the way in which
     operators become coupled, by training and habit, to the dynamics of the processes

                  1983a). According to Norman, mental models provide

  abstract = {Gigerenzer and his colleagues have sought to develop
                  psychologically plausible models of human
                  judgment. Their models are classified as ones of
                  bounded rationality based on a principle of
                  one-reason decision making. The models associated
                  with the theory of Probabilistic Mental Models (PMM)
                  have been developed for tasks in which all
                  predictors are binary. This article extends PMM to
                  the case of continuous predictors. The current model
                  employs the limitation on the number of categories
                  people use in making absolute judgments along a
                  single perceptual dimension (7 1 2; Miller,
                  1956). The algorithm transforms each continuous
                  predictor to be consistent with this limitation,
                  then implements a step-down one-reason decision
                  procedure similar to previous PMM models. Like
                  previous PMM models, the 7 1 2 model predicts binary
                  judgments as well as a multiple-regression
                  model. However, the model does not successfully
                  predict the probability judgments of individual
                  participants, which is also true of all other models
                  in the literature.},
