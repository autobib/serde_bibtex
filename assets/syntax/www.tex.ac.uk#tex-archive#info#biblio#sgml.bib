                 usable by both technical and nontechnical people, (2)
                 the notation should require only a standard ASCII

                 at the places where changes occur, and (4) the notation

                 standard for encoding literary texts. The Standard
                 Generalized Markup Language (SGML) seems to provide the
                 best basis for such a standard. But two problems
                 inhibit the acceptance of SGML for this purpose:
                 computer-assisted textual studies often require the
                 maintenance of multiple views of a document's
                 structure, but SGML is not designed to accommodate such
                 views; an SGML-based standard would appear to entail
                 the keyboarding of more markup than researchers are
                 accustomed to, or are likely to accept. The authors
                 discuss five ways of dealing with the first problem,
                 and several ways of reducing the burden of markup. They
                 conclude that the problem of maintaining multiple views
                 can be surmounted, though with some difficulty, and
                 that the markup required for an SGML-based standard can
                 be reduced to a level comparable to that of other
                 markup schemes currently in use.",

                 Character representation in computer memory, on VDUs
                 and on printers is heavily device dependent. This is
                 exemplified with references to existing computer
                 equipment. This hardware dependency makes it necessary
                 to use local character encoding to get the most out of
                 equipment at hand. This again necessitates a
                 standardized encoding to be used when textual data is
                 exchanged. Such a standard should be developed within
                 the SGML framework. The Norwegian Computing Centre for
                 the Humanities sees the development of standards for
                 encoding complex textual data as one of its main fields

                 Office Document Architecture (ODA) is expected in the
                 course of 1988. The final text is already available.

                 1986. Contractor interest in Computer-aided Acquisition

                 of respondees indicated that they have established or

                 analysis of a questionnaire circulated recently by the
                 European Physical Society shows that there is an
                 abundance of different hardware and software in use by
                 physics authors for electronic manuscript preparation.
                 A standard interchange format which would permit
                 authors to continue to use their preferred system as
                 well as enabling document interchange seems imperative
                 if one wishes to achieve the goal of electronic
                 submission of machine readable documents directly to
                 publishers. A possible candidate could be SGML, the ISO
                 standard for text interchange. Use of this standard
                 would generate additional benefits such as the
                 automatic generation of document databases. The
                 relationships between the ISO standards SGML and ODA,
                 the de facto standard \TeX{} and the page description

                 for the structure of a standard physics article
                 intended for use with SGML and \TeX{}. A short
                 discussion is given on the thorny problem of the
                 inclusion of mathematics and graphics that are
                 particularly common in physics documents. Finally they

                 6353 letters including hiragana, kana and kanji are
                 required in the Japanese language. This causes
                 complication when a Japanese DTP system is formed.
                 Though the concept of DTP was recently introduced in
                 Japan, numerous electronic publishing systems like
                 computerized type-setting system (CTS) have been used
                 for preparation of block copies and page compositions
                 since late 1970s. 1989 is considered the first year of
                 DTP since binary script software systems similar to
                 PostScript and laser printers with >400 dpi and
                 built-in kanji fonts based on medium-to-small sized
                 computers began to appear in the local market. For
                 example, a NEC 9801 based system with a 480 dpi laser

                 searching, referred to here as online searching aids.
                 Intermediary mechanisms are examined in terms of the
                 two stage model, i.e. end-user, intermediary, `raw
                 database', and different forms of user-system
                 interaction are discussed. The evolution of the
                 terminology of online searching aids is presented with
                 special emphasis on the expert/non-expert division.
                 Terms defined include gateways, front-end systems,
                 intermediary systems and post-processing. The
                 alternative configurations that such systems can have
                 and the approaches to the design of the user interface
                 are discussed. The review then analyses the functions
                 of online searching aids, i.e. logon procedures, access
                 to hosts, help features, search formulation, query

                 downloading and post-processing. Costs are then briefly

                 trends following recent developments in computer
                 science and elsewhere. Distributed expert based
                 information systems (DEBIS), the standard generalized

                 (ORW) is being pursued, which is targeted at the
                 complete life-cycle of a publication. Publication is,
                 within the ORW program, being generalized to include
                 both hard-copy and online formats. In order to proceed
                 within one environment and include both output formats
                 a decision was made to encode text with SGML and, where
                 possible, use the Association of American Publishers
                 (AAP) Electronic Manuscript Standard for Document Type
                 Book. While the desirability of so encoding the text is
                 obvious from the perspective of hard-copy publishing,
                 the potential ramifications are even more pronounced in
                 terms of online storage and retrieval. The greatest
                 advantage from the perspective of the latter is the
                 unambiguous identification of objects for retrieval.
                 The paper addresses the following topics: aspects of a
                 user interface for editing and creation of both
                 SGML-encoded text and bibliographic references,

                 recently developed. These standards view documents as
                 hierarchical objects and it is likely that languages
                 such as SGML will become widely used in the near future

                 available, so there will be a need to evolve tools to
                 take advantage of structural knowledge. The work
                 described develops such tools. A conceptual model for

                 organizations as the medium for exchange of
                 electronically encoded documents. A medium for

                 exchange is accomplished by way of a Document Type
                 Definition, DTD, that describes the content of the
                 documents targeted for an exchange. In this paper we
                 suggest guidelines for the designers of SGML DTDs. The

                 use some of the `traditional' publishing skills. DTP
                 can cope with different types of input (text, images,
                 etc.), is easier to read, more authoritative, more
                 effective in communicating, uses less paper, and
                 facilitates multiple and multimedia output. When the
                 documentation of a device outweighs the device itself
                 and when the documentation needs frequent updating then
                 DTP can save much money. The minimum requirements for
                 DTP are a PC, a screen to show input or output, a
                 printer (preferably a laser printer) to print the
                 output, a keyboard, a mouse and some DTP software. In
                 addition to creating pages the software should support
                 document retrieval, document management, revision
                 control, revision tracking, distribution, and

                 standard 8879 in 1986. Today, commercial use of the
                 SGML standard has been started in the US and Europe. In

                 Recently, SGML has been expected to increase the

                 to prepare a SGML-coded text using a conventional word
                 processor of text editor, the user must have thorough
                 knowledge of the SGML, and understand the structure of
                 the document. To solve this problem, an SGML structured
                 editor has been developed. The editor gives guidance to
                 the user how to mark the document correctly. It
                 displays the marks of the structure elements before the
                 user inputs the text so that the document structure is

                 These maps are represented by a network of clusters

                 represented by nodes and links structures. The node
                 contents are multimedia, mixing text and images.
                 Therefore the clusters are hyperdocuments. The authors
                 emphasize the SDOC data structures (use of formats and
                 standards), and the potential of SGML for generating
                 hypertext structures. They discuss the integration of

                 by formal logic approaches. Complementary to this, a
                 plea is made to start an argumentational analysis of
                 the-highly structured-corpus of scientific articles
                 (mainly in physics). Such an analysis might lead to an
                 argumentational syntax which will also enable the
                 nonexpert to browse through large quantities of
                 electronically stored articles. A first attempt at such
                 an approach is given. Furthermore the possible use of
                 the standard general markup language (SGML) approach in
                 relation to a hypertext environment for a possible
                 application is discussed.",

                 programme covering various topics including compilers,
                 OSI protocols, and computer graphics. In 1988 the CEC
                 launched their second CTS programme (CTS-2) to cover

                 establish harmonised conformance testing services for

                 Descriptive markup is a means whereby the logical
                 structure of a document can be explicitly encoded. Such
                 markup can subsequently be processed to provide an
                 appropriate physical layout of the actual document
                 content. Additionally, the logical structure provides
                 the information necessary for highly context sensitive
                 retrieval. The authors describe an SGML application
                 which can process encoded documents into a format
                 suitable for storage and retrieval by an appropriately
                 powerful retrieval system. It is also possible to

                 applications. These are processes which make use of the
                 underlying communications architecture and services.
                 Their purpose is to handle data on behalf of users: for
                 storage, manipulation and display, as well as for
                 transfer. This application layer is itself layered. In
                 particular, the applications processes manipulate
                 information which is encoded in a defined structure,
                 which has specific semantics. The encoding often
                 represents numeric and alphabetic characters. To
                 successfully achieve the open interchange of such
                 information, it is necessary to have an agreed
                 international standard representation. There is a range
                 of character encoding schemes (from IS 646 to DIS

                 three other structural mechanisms for imparting
                 semantics upon data streams. The document encoding

                 development schedule management system, and so on.
                 STUFF applies SGML (Standard Generalization Markup
                 Language) to describe document structures, and all
                 documents developed by STUFF are stored in SGML-DB. In
                 SGML-DB, not only document contents and document
                 structures but also their handling schema (user
                 interface schema and transmission control data) are
                 stored, so modifications of the application, such as
                 changing document structures and altering user
                 interfaces, become easier. The authors applied SGML as

                 indicate in a standard way what kind of notation is
                 used in them. When an electronic document is created,
                 its author should be able to incorporate active
                 references to other on-line documents ('hyperlinks'),
                 regardless of the heterogeneity of their notations. In
                 other words, there should be a standard way to make
                 `information about information' interoperable. The
                 proposed standard `HyTime' hypermedia time-based
                 document structuring language (ISO/IEC Draft
                 International Standard 10744), built on the Standard
                 Generalized Markup Language (SGML), is designed to make
                 all this possible. By using SGML/HyTime, all kinds of
                 documents can package their information content using
                 standard `markup'. This markup provides information
                 about the structure and notation of the document in a
                 way that is understandable or interpretable by any
                 application that has been provided with an appropriate
                 data importation facility. The `structured' character
                 of such documents also makes them amenable to

                 documents' but each document production system uses its
                 own `markup' commands. These are rarely compatible with
                 each other and cannot reproduce documentation in
                 different media, as they are linked only to the
                 physical structure of the document in question. To
                 overcome these drawbacks, information processing
                 specialists have tried to create general languages

  abstract =     "SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is an ISO
                 standard that specifies a language for document
                 representation. The main idea behind SGML is to
                 strictly separate the structure and contents of a
                 document from the processing of that document. This
                 results in application-independent and thus reusable
                 documents. To gain the full benefit of this approach,
                 tools are needed to support a wide range of
                 applications. The standard itself does not decline how
                 to specify the processing of documents. Many existing
                 SGML systems allow for a simple translation of an SGML
                 document, which exhibits a 1-1 correspondence between
                 elements in the SGML document and its translation. For
                 many applications this does not suffice. In other
                 systems the processing can be expressed in a
                 special-purpose programming language. The various
                 approaches to processing SGML documents are assessed.
                 The authors also discuss a novel approach, taken in the
                 Amsterdam SGML Parser. In this approach, processing
                 actions are embedded in the grammar rules that specify
                 the document structure, much like processing actions
                 are embedded in grammars of programming languages that
                 are input to a parser generator.",

                 architecture, in both its inner structure and its user

                 markup language. Markup refers to adding style and
                 formatting information to text prior to publication. It
                 is a `standard' because SGML has been accepted and
                 published by the ISO and is not owned by any
                 manufacturer or software vendor. It is `generalized'
                 because SGML is powerful and flexible, allowing it to
                 be used in many applications. And it is a `language'
                 that embodies a specification for creation of a set of
                 rules to define the structure of a document. SGML has
                 been designed to easily cross incompatible computer
                 platforms, and its `open' nature allows for relatively
                 simple access and manipulation of an SGML conforming
                 document by both people and computers. Above all, SGML
                 proposes a new way of thinking about document creation
                 and presentation, by shifting document style
                 considerations to the publication process rather than
                 the creation process. This is done by dividing the
                 document into named, logical elements, to which any
                 style can be later applied. A by-product of this
                 approach is the effective creation of a flexible
                 database, providing further access to the data for

                 language (SGML) provides a syntactic meta-language for
                 the definition of textual markup systems. In the
                 standard the right hand sides of productions are called
                 content models and they are based on regular
                 expressions. The allowable regular expressions are
                 those that are `unambiguous' as defined by the
                 standard. Unfortunately, the standard's use of the term
                 `unambiguous' does not correspond to the two well known
                 notions, since not all regular languages are denoted by
                 `unambiguous' expressions. Furthermore, the standard's
                 definition of `unambiguous' is somewhat vague. The
                 authors provide a precise definition of `unambiguous
                 expressions' and rename them deterministic regular
                 expressions to avoid any confusion. A regular
                 expression E is deterministic if the canonical
                 epsilon-free finite automaton M/sub E/ recognizing L(E)
                 is deterministic. A regular language is deterministic
                 if there is a deterministic expression that denotes it.
                 The authors give a Kleene-like theorem for
                 deterministic regular languages and characterize them
                 in terms of the structural properties of the minimal
                 deterministic automata recognizing them. The latter
                 result enables them to decide if a given regular
                 expression denotes a deterministic regular language
                 and, if so, to construct an equivalent deterministic

                 This report shows the relationship between traditional
                 formal languages and SGML doctype specifications. In
                 particular, it is a data point to show that the usage
                 of terms in the SGML community does not conform to the
                 canonical meaning in CS\@. The report shows that one
                 can decide if a given regular expression is equivalent
                 to a valid SGML doctype, and that one can do this
                 transformation. The algorithm for the transformation is
                 exponential; it is not known if this is a time-optimal
                 algorithm.''",

                 water-cooled mainframe processors are made possible by
                 improvements in component- and system-level cooling.
                 The heart of the closed-loop water-cooling system is a
                 coolant distribution frame (CDF) common to all
                 water-cooled processors. The CDF provides a controlled
                 water temperature of 21.7 degrees C to the central
                 electronic complex (CEC) at water flow rates up to 245
                 liters per minute (lpm) and rejects heat loads of up to
                 63 kW for the largest processor. The water flow
                 provides cooling to multichip thermal conduction
                 modules (TCMs), to power supplies, and to air-to-water
                 heat exchangers that provide preconditioned air to
                 channel and memory cards. As many as 121 chips are
                 mounted on a TCM glass-ceramic substrate, with chip
                 powers reaching 27 W or a heat flux of 64 W/cm/sup 2/.
                 A separable cold plate was developed to cool these
                 modules. The power supplies with high heat densities
                 are primarily cooled by water which flows through a
                 unique separable cold plate designed for ease of
                 serviceability of the power supply. A closed-loop frame

                 problem is that posed by the need, in most systems, to
                 store two versions of imported text. The first is the
                 native version, as it might have come from a word
                 processor to text editor. The second is the ASCII
                 version which is what is actually imported. Inverted
                 file indexes form yet another version. The problem
                 arises out of the need for dynamic indexing and
                 re-indexing of revisable documents in very large
                 database applications such as are found in office
                 automation systems. Four mainstream text-management
                 packages are used to show how this problem is handled,
                 and how generic document architectures such as OCA/CDA
                 and SGML might help.",

                 delivering information on screen. The concept of
                 electronic book is based on the metaphor of a paper
                 book, but it multiplies the ways people can access and
                 manipulate the information it contains. The reader can
                 now search and find parts of the book he is interested
                 in; he can navigate in the document, annotate it, mark
                 pages either to print them or just to remember where
                 the information is: things that were difficult to do on
                 paper. The application selected to explore this new
                 domain is the viewing of R and D division annual
                 projects, which were up to now available only on a
                 database. The tool used for this is Dynatext, a product
                 of EBT, based on the structured information description
                 language SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up Language).
                 The authors test the concept of electronic book and try
                 to use the SGML standard to exchange data. The first

                 pump out everything from worldwide interoffice memos to
                 huge manuals and glossy sales brochures. They can even

                 $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the degrees of freedom.
                 Traditionally, $x_{p}$ is found using a numerical
                 root-finding method, such as Newton's method. In this
                 paper, a procedure based on a series expansion for
                 finding $x_{p}$is given. The series expansion method
                 has been applied to the normal, chi-square, and $t$

                 difficulties, it has not been applied to the

                 making the standard transformation to the beta

                 Sections 3 and 4. Empirical results of a comparison of
                 CPU times are given in Section 5. The series expansion

                 Microsoft's vision of SGML is to broaden the
                 accessibility of this technology without requiring
                 users to understand the details of the technology. The
                 largest problem facing SGML usage is the increased cost
                 of tagging documents due to decreased productivity. The
                 currently available SGML editing tools are typically
                 not very user friendly and are designed almost
                 exclusively for the UNIX environment. The approach
                 contrasts rather starkly with the current offerings,
                 and Microsoft hope that their product will result in
                 highly increased author productivity by allowing
                 authors to work in a familiar and comfortable editing

                 constructed in a time quadratic in the size of the
                 expression, and that this is worst-case optimal. For
                 deterministic expressions, his algorithm has even
                 linear run time. This improves on the cubic time
                 methods suggested in the literature (Book et al. 1971;
                 Aho et al. 1986; Berry and Sethi 1986). A major step of
                 the algorithm consists in bringing the expression into
                 what is called star normal form. This concept is also
                 useful for characterizing the relationship between two
                 types of unambiguity that have been studied in the
                 literature. Namely, the author shows that, modulo a
                 technical condition, an expression is strongly
                 unambiguous (Sippu and Soisalon-Soininen 1988) if and
                 only if it is weakly unambiguous (Book et al. 1971) and
                 in star-normal form. This leads to his third result, a
                 quadratic-time decision algorithm for weak unambiguity,
                 that improves on the biquadratic method introduced by

                 document types are defined by context-free grammars in
                 an extended Backus-Naur form. The right-hand side of a
                 production is called a content model. Content models
                 are extended regular expressions that have to be
                 unambiguous in the sense that `an element \ldots{} that
                 occurs in the document instance must be able to satisfy
                 only one primitive content token without looking ahead
                 in the document instance.' The author presents a
                 linear-time algorithm that decides whether a given
                 content model is unambiguous. A similar result has
                 previously been obtained not for content models but for
                 the smaller class of standard regular expressions. It
                 relies on the fact that the languages of marked regular
                 expressions are local-a property that does not hold any
                 more for content models that contain the new and
                 ?-operator. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new
                 techniques for content models. Besides solving an
                 interesting problem in formal language theory, the
                 author's results are relevant for developers of SGML
                 systems. In fact, his definitions are causing changes
                 to the revised edition of the SGML standard, and the
                 algorithm to test content models for unambiguity has

                 Subcommittee 18 (JTC1/SC18/WG8) is tasked with
                 developing information technology (IT) standards for
                 use in text and office systems. The standard
                 generalized markup language (SGML) introduced by WG8 in
                 1986 is one of the key standards in developing systems
                 for open information interchange (OII). In November
                 1992 WG8 published an important new standard, based on
                 SGML, for the interchange of multimedia and hypermedia
                 data. The hypermedia/time-based structuring language
                 (HyTime) provides hypermedia and multimedia systems
                 developers with a standardized way of representing
                 their data sets when interchanging information with
                 other systems. Since the publication of the HyTime

                 documentation described arose from a need to supply
                 documentation for a large library of mathematical
                 software. There has been a growing demand to supply
                 documentation in a variety of printed and online
                 formats, tailored to the particular needs of end users.
                 There is also an increasing number of new products
                 which contain the original library as an embedded
                 sub-component. First attempts to meet the demand for
                 diverse forms of documentation led to the creation of
                 many different bodies of text, containing similar
                 information, but maintained and often authored
                 separately. The solution to this problem was to develop
                 a database which contains all the information
                 previously held in the library documentation. The
                 database can be used to generate both the original
                 documents and new documents with varying style, format
                 or content. There were two main processes involved in
                 the transformation of documents to database records.
                 The first was an object-oriented decomposition of the
                 documented product, identifying all the sub-components
                 and the important information relating to each one. The
                 second process was to mark up text records using the
                 Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), an ISO
                 standard (8879) for the mark up of computer-held

                 distributed database that integrates knowledge base
                 technology with database systems to provide cooperative
                 (approximate and conceptual) query answering. Based on
                 the database schema and application characteristics,
                 data are organized into conceptual (type abstraction)
                 hierarchies. The higher levels of the hierarchy provide
                 a more abstract data representation than the lower
                 levels. Generalization (moving up in the hierarchy),
                 specialization (moving down in the hierarchy) and
                 association (moving between hierarchies) are the three
                 key operations in deriving cooperative query answers.
                 Relaxation in CoBase can also be specified explicitly
                 in the query by the user or calling program through
                 cooperative operators. We have extended SQL to CSQL by
                 adding cooperative primitives. We describe the CoBase
                 software implementation, including an inter-module data
                 protocol that provides a uniform module interface. This
                 modular approach provides flexibility in adding new
                 relaxation modules and simplifies software maintenance.
                 CoBase uses LOOM as its knowledge representation and
                 inference system and supports relational data bases
                 (e.g. Oracle and Sybase). We have demonstrated the
                 feasibility and functionality of CoBase on top of a
                 Transportation Database. The CoBase methodology has
                 also been adopted in multimedia medical distributed
                 database project at UCLA, which provides approximate
                 query answers to medical queries.",

                 information about medical events than is possible using
                 databases. In order to realize the full potential of
                 this increased information content, techniques will be
                 required that go beyond the static mapping of stored
                 data into a single, rigid data model. Through
                 intelligent processing, loosely structured documents

                 intelligently help a scientist navigate through
                 electronic versions of published scientific papers. The

                 phrasal lexicon processed documents from the biology
                 research literature. The Assistant allows the scientist
                 to navigate through the full documents on the screen,

                 daily basis. These demands come from end users,
                 database vendors, MIS, consultants, among others. Those
                 associated with the industry want data that: costs
                 less, is quicker to access, has more quality, is easier
                 to update or manipulate across platforms, and contains
                 more pertinent information. To accommodate these
                 demands the industry must provide clients with
                 state-of-the-art solutions for their image or text
                 capture, keyword indexing, and tagging needs. The
                 state-of-the-industry concepts, approaches, and
                 technology must be employed to meet this challenge.
                 High quality output in image form is required to fully
                 address this challenge. Graphics-related materials need
                 to have proper document preparation, must be carefully
                 scanned (with rigid quality assurance), and perhaps
                 linked to a keyword index. Text capture via optical
                 character recognition (OCR) can be a cost-effective
                 option versus keyboarding. Cost-effective use of OCR
                 tools depends, among other factors, on content of the
                 source material, its physical condition, and desired
                 accuracy level of the output. Adding or updating a
                 keyword index to a textual database is a way to add
                 value to the information. These editorial enhancements
                 could be accomplished through the use of editorial
                 staff, automated routines (machine aided indexing) or a
                 combination of the two. Crucial factors to be
                 considered are time, uniqueness of the data, and
                 budgetary constraints. Tagging text in a very
                 structured manner allows for its use in different
                 environments. Structured tagging means the text could
                 be used to produce a print product while simultaneously
                 aiding end users performing online searches of flat
                 files or relational databases. Standard Generalized
                 Markup Language (SGML) is one such scheme that marks
                 each data element as a distinct entity, including type
                 style and size, thereby preserving it for future
                 applications. Choosing the most appropriate path and
                 tying these various options together is the trick in
                 producing a high quality CD-ROM product",

                 (insertions, deletions, and updates) to the relations.
                 The view definitions can be in SQL or Datalog, and may
                 use UNION, negation, aggregation (e.g. SUM, MIN),
                 linear recursion, and general recursion. We first
                 present a counting algorithm that tracks the number of
                 alternative derivations (counts) for each derived tuple
                 in a view. The algorithm works with both set and
                 duplicate semantics. We present the algorithm for
                 nonrecursive views (with negation and aggregation), and
                 show that the count for a tuple can be computed at
                 little or no cost above the cost of deriving the tuple.
                 The algorithm is optimal in that it computes exactly
                 those view tuples that are inserted or deleted. Note
                 that we store only the number of derivations, not the
                 derivations themselves. We then present the Delete and
                 Rederive algorithm, DRed, for incremental maintenance
                 of recursive views (negation and aggregation are
                 permitted). The algorithm works by first deleting a
                 superset of the tuples that need to be deleted, and
                 then rederiving some of them. The algorithm can also be
                 used when the view definition is itself altered.",

  abstract =     "The traditional focus of relational query optimization
                 schemes has been on the choice of join methods and join
                 orders. Restrictions have typically been handled in
                 query optimizers by `predicate pushdown' rules, which
                 apply restrictions in some random order before as many
                 joins as possible. These rules work under the
                 assumption that restriction is essentially a zero-time
                 operation. However, today's extensible and
                 object-oriented database systems allow users to define
                 time-consuming functions, which may be used in a
                 query's restriction and join predicates. Furthermore,
                 SQL has long supported subquery predicates, which may
                 be arbitrarily time-consuming to check. Thus
                 restrictions should not be considered zero-time
                 operations, and the model of query optimization must be
                 enhanced. In this paper we develop a theory for moving
                 expensive predicates in a query plan so that the total
                 cost of the plan --- including the costs of both joins
                 and restrictions --- is minimal. We present an
                 algorithm to implement the theory, as well as results
                 of our implementation in POSTGRES. Our experience with
                 the newly enhanced POSTGRES query optimizer
                 demonstrates that correctly optimizing queries with
                 expensive predicates often produces plans that are
                 orders of magnitude faster than plans generated by a
                 traditional query optimizer. The additional complexity
                 of considering expensive predicates during optimization
                 is found to be manageably small.",

                 which allow publishers, electronic and software
                 companies to share expertise and resources while
                 developing hypermedia. (S)GML is proposed as an
                 effective and flexible way to describe semantic
                 attributes between the concept entities in the
                 hypermedia resources. It gives the opportunity to
                 describe the meaning of concept relations at a
                 declarative level without actually changing the
                 information itself. The preparation of hypermedia
                 programs for CD-I, CD-ROM(XA) and CDTV is described in
                 six preliminary steps, adding meta-information by
                 domain experts and secondary authors. After these
                 steps, eight phases of multimedia production are
                 distinguished. The role of a hypermedia tool in these
                 eight phases is essential. It should primarily relieve
                 the hypermedia developer from keeping track of all the
                 assigned relations in the hypermedia database. The
                 technique of (S)GML-based design is of importance to
                 those projects which prefer to be generic for all types

                 will very likely be implemented with client/server
                 architectures where special-purpose servers work
                 together in a loosely coupled environment to deliver
                 information to their clients. This information will
                 include text and also other forms of data such as
                 image, graphic or tabular data. These systems will
                 incorporate and extend the idea of markup to include
                 the content of a variety of object types as well as
                 text objects. This extended marking of objects will
                 function in much the same way that SGML functions today
                 for documents. This marking will provide for data
                 interchange, structuring and output interpretation.
                 Object content marking (tokenization) will add
                 intelligence and programmability to database objects
                 and provide the basis for standardizing object

                 systems will be extended to databases and the objects
                 they contain. Therefore, text objects will be more
                 formal in order to function in future information
                 delivery systems. These text objects will contain
                 structures of instance variables which will enable

                 facilitated by international standards (SGML, HyTime),
                 and a widely accepted hypertext reference model (the
                 Dexter model). The model, called the Dexter-groupware

                 with SQL --- style grouping, set generation and

                 hints in the form of high-level annotations. There is
                 an interface to C++ that enables programs to be written
                 in a combination of imperative and declarative styles.
                 Another notable feature is its extensibility. New data

                 for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of broadband
                 sources with unknown spectral parameters. One is based
                 on the assumption that the sources radiate
                 stochastic-Gaussian signals and therefore is called the
                 stochastic-Gaussian ML (SGML) estimator; the other,
                 using estimates of the actual signals (not their
                 assumed distribution), is called the conditional ML
                 (CML) estimator. Neither is efficient if the source
                 spectral parameters are completely arbitrary and
                 unknown, but the problem can be avoided for a version
                 of the SGML estimation if the signal and noise spectra
                 are known to satisfy certain smoothness conditions.
                 While this version of the SGML is formally superior to
                 the CML, it is demonstrated that the performance
                 difference is small with underconditions not
                 infrequently encountered in practice. When these are
                 satisfied, the computationally simpler CML can be used
                 without significant loss. The required conditions
                 become more stringent as the source separation
                 decreases or correlation between sources increases. A
                 closed-form analytic expression is obtained for the

  annote-1 =     "Harry Gaylord comments: ``Much nonsense and hype has
                 been written about hypertext. Much software has been
                 written to produce hypertext documents which are high
                 on pzaz and whistles and bangs, but requires
                 painstaking work on the part of the writer. Revising
                 the documents often means that they have to be
                 time-consumingly debugged in obscure ways before they
                 can be used again. Documents cannot be used in any
                 other system except the one they were written in. More
                 importantly often the documents have to be broken up
                 first into structures which are not inherent to the
                 document. A library card catalogue contains cards, a
                 newspaper or a novel doesn't. To force a novel into
                 cards violates the very structure of the document.
                 Other so-called hypertext systems are organised very
                 simply and do what they claim to do very well, but
                 documents produced in them will have to be
                 substantially revised when more facilities are
                 required. To create order out of this, ISO
                 JTC1/SC18/WG8 created a group to draw up a standard for
                 hypertext. The result of this work is ISO 10744:1992
                 HyTime. About the same time, the Text Encoding
                 Initiative appointed a hypertext committee of four
                 members. Its chair was DeRose and the members include
                 Durand, Ed Fox, and Eve Wilson. The committee has
                 proposed important revisions and extensions to HyTime,
                 and the TEI Guidelines include all the query facilities
                 of HyTime plus other extensions. If these extensions
                 are found useful in the wider community, they will be
                 incorporated in the next revision of HyTime. This is
                 the first book to appear on HyTime. Eliot Kimber is
                 preparing one which is scheduled to appear in August,
                 and Charles Goldfarb is working on another which is
                 being modeled on the SGML Handbook in that it will
                 include the commented standard itself. This book is
                 divided into three parts. Part 1 is called Introducing
                 HyTime. This is the most general and provides an
                 excellent starting point for anyone who needs to know
                 what HyTime is, what its relation to SGML is, what its
                 modules are, and why anyone who is producing or using
                 electronic documents needs SGML and/or HyTime products.
                 For many this will be enough to convince them that they
                 should hand the book on to their software purchasers
                 and implementors to get to work.''",
  annote-2 =     "``Part 2 is entitled Basic HyTime. The chapters
                 include Basic Measurement, Hyperlinks, Locating Data
                 Objects, The HyTime Query Language, and Modifying a DTD
                 for HyTime. Many hours of my time would have been saved
                 if I had received this section when I received the
                 draft of the standard itself. When one reads this part
                 carefully, one has a clear idea of most of the details
                 involved in HyTime. One of my strongest criticisms of
                 HyTime is the obscure short names. They could have been
                 clear if the committee had not decided to limit name
                 lengths to less than 8 letters as was specified in SGML
                 Reference Syntax. As it is only insiders in the work on
                 the standard itself can understand what they actually
                 refer to. Part 3 is entitled Intermediate HyTime. Here
                 are the extra detailed treatments of aspects of HyTime
                 which implementors need to know. Appendixes include the
                 HyTime Meta-DTD with its corrections and Graphic
                 Notations. The book is concluded with a bibliography,
                 glossary, and index. If I understand the authors, the
                 highest level of hypertext which can be reached at the
                 moment is Intermediate, not Advanced. The field is too
                 young. They are, of course, right in this. It is no
                 accident that these authors are part of that Brown
                 group which has spread out to Boston now. It has been
                 the major center for producing systems for structuring
                 and linking highly complex documents and have built
                 extensive experience since the 1960's. The didactic
                 arrangement is impressive. Basic issues are discussed
                 clearly first and nuances are added later when they are
                 needed by the reader. It is not often that in a very
                 complex subject the authors so clearly have understood
                 what is forest and what is trees, and have been such
                 good guides to the uninitiated and initiated alike.
                 With this book I have a proper coursebook for my
                 students this year. If you want to know about
                 electronic documents which are usable in more than one
                 system and future-oriented, then you should buy this
                 book without waiting for anything else to appear. It
                 provides an excellent introduction for the general
                 reader, and thorough treatment for those who need
                 it.''",

  abstract =     "The Multi-Owner Maintenance spider (MOMspider) has
                 been developed to partially solve the complex
                 maintenance problem acquired by the growth of the
                 infostructure of the World-Wide Web. MOMspider can
                 periodically traverse a list of webs, check each web
                 for any changes that requires the owner's attention,
                 and build special index document that lists out the
                 attributes and connections of the web in a form that
                 can itself be traversed as a hypertext document. The
                 paper describes the design of the MOMspider, how it was
                 influenced by the nature of distributed hypertext
                 maintenance, and requirements for the good behavior of
                 any web-traversing robot.",

                 whether the time is right, and then to decide how to
                 implement an electronic version of their print journals
                 or a totally new electronic-only journal. Decisions
                 must be made on SGML vs. scanned pages, and CD-ROM vs.
                 online. Most importantly, publishers need to determine
                 how their electronic products can offer superior value
                 to scholars and researchers, because the journals will
                 fail if they are perceived to be less valuable than
                 their print counterparts. As telecommunications access
                 speeds increase and online storage costs decrease,
                 distribution of journals complete with high-quality
                 photographs, tables, and equations through online
                 systems becomes increasingly viable. The electronic
                 medium can be exploited to add links to relevant
                 bibliographic databases as well as to other relevant
                 journals. Comprehensive information can be made
                 instantly available to users through one easy-to-use
                 interface.",

                 They describe texts by their structure, operations on

                 operations. In this article common characteristics of
                 machine readable texts in general are outlined.
                 Subsequently, ten text models are introduced. They are
                 described in terms of the datatypes that they support,
                 and the operations defined by these datatypes. Finally,
                 the models are compared. The models include the TDM

                 attempts to maintain consistency among the various
                 design and program documents of a software system.
                 Unfortunately, the majority of the literate programming
                 tools do not have appropriate user interfaces and
                 require the users to learn complicated and cryptic
                 tagging languages. SGML is a metalanguage used to
                 specify markup or tagging languages that can be used to
                 encode the structure of documents. This paper describes
                 how a markup language defined using SGML can be used as
                 the basic method for structuring literate programming
                 documents and can be made independent of the
                 programming language. Furthermore, with SGML and tools
                 to browse and edit SGML documents, literate programs
                 can benefit from WYSIWYG editing and hypertext
                 capabilities and can even include pictures and other
                 graphics. In addition, syntax-directed editors that
                 support SGML can hide the markup tags and thus remove
                 the need to learn a markup language. Text databases
                 that use SGML can also be used to store literate
                 programs. As a result, literate programs can be browsed
                 and queried using complex search expressions, a
                 capability beyond most text editors. For example, the
                 searches can involve combinations of structural and
                 textual information. Because SGML is a popular and
                 emerging standard, we can expect to have more powerful
                 tools to manipulate many different forms of design and
                 program documentation. This paper describes the issues
                 involved in the development of a literate programming
                 environment that uses SGML as the storage model.",

  abstract =     "The interest in having high maintainable versions of a
                 document in both paper and WWW formats is growing
                 dramatically as WWW is fast becoming the most important
                 way of browsing and delivering information on the
                 {Internet}. This paper discusses the strategy based on
                 FrameMaker, a desktop publishing package from Frame
                 Technology Corporation, and the configurable translator
                 WebMaker, written by the authors, for the simultaneous
                 production of paper and WWW versions of a document.
                 Advantages of this scheme are the WYSIWYG FrameMaker
                 interface, easily maintainable WWW documents, and the
                 possibility to obtain a WWW version of already existent
                 Frame documents by simply supplying configuration
                 information for their conversion. The introduction
                 provides some background information and outlines the
                 strategy. The second section is a comparison of the two
                 formats, feature by feature, outlining the behavior of
                 WebMaker for each feature. The third section focuses on
                 WebMaker and discusses the general user requirements
                 and the WWW document generation process. The WebMaker
                 configuration language is briefly discussed. The fourth
                 section presents a list of recommendations for writers
                 as a guideline for the simultaneous preparation of both
                 the paper and WWW documents. A few words on future
                 directions are given at the end.",

  abstract =     "This paper provides a brief description of a software
                 tool developed within the TLTP Interact Project which
                 allows application programs, concurrently executing
                 within a Unix environment, to be controlled by scripts
                 delivered to Mosaic from W3 servers. This tool was
                 developed to allow the coupling of interactive
                 simulations of scientific and engineering phenomena
                 with courseware provided by W3. This software is known
                 as the Interact Communication Facility (ICF). The
                 features of the ICF include the ability to allow
                 application programs to receive control messages and
                 data from scripts embedded as links within HTML
                 documents; the use of HTML fill-out forms to enter data
                 intended for application programs; a simple interface
                 to allow programs to control Mosaic, including the
                 automatic execution of Mosaic if it is not currently
                 being used, a means of allowing secure execution of
                 applications from scripts. This avoids the security
                 problems associated with allowing Mosaic to interpret
                 arbitrary shell scripts. This paper provides an
                 overview of the ICF together with an example showing
                 the use of Mosaic in conjunction with a simple
                 graphical program.",

                 user requirements for `intelligent' electronic access
                 to building codes and standards. Hypertext is a useful
                 tool, but it only assists users in text browsing and
                 searching. More sophisticated techniques are available,
                 but few applications exist as commercial products.
                 Information technologies should be seen as an
                 opportunity for building code users and code writing
                 bodies, not as a problem. The authors feel that
                 building code writing bodies are an essential component
                 in the production of `intelligent' building code
                 information. All code writing bodies are therefore
                 encouraged to investigate the maintenance and
                 publication of electronic documents, their future may
                 depend on it. This paper describes the standards

                 conducted at The University of Arizona, Department of
                 Computer Science. Each June, 50 junior high kids attend
                 one of two, [sic] one-week sessions. For 1994 and 1995,
                 the curriculum has focused on the Internet and the use
                 of Mosaic and associated tools. These lessons were
                 developed for this course in May 1994, revised and
                 updated in May 1995, and tested during Capers each
                 year. They are being made available in a variety of
                 formats [html, postscript, hard copy, FrameMaker] in
                 the hope that they may prove useful to others. The
                 lessons have two main goals. The first is to
                 familiarize students with Mosaic and its supporting
                 tools on Macintosh computers so the students can
                 explore the World Wide Web. The second goal is to
                 encourage students to develop their own home pages,
                 learning the basics of HTML and how to include
                 pictures, sounds, movies, and links. The first two
                 lessons provide an introduction to using the Macintosh.
                 Lessons three through seven cover the use of Mosaic and
                 its principal support tools: JPEGView, MoviePlayer,
                 Sparkle and Sound Machine. Lesson eight provides some
                 starting points for net surfing, including a number of
                 sites to explore. Finally, lessons nine and ten cover
                 designing and writing home pages.",

                 searchability but makes consistent and precise display

  abstract =     "Current World-Wide Web technologies concentrate on
                 presenting documents to human readers. Although HTML
                 identifies structures within a document, it does not
                 allow the semantic content of document sections to be
                 specified explicitly. We investigate a small extension
                 to HTML which allows parts of a document to be mapped
                 onto an underlying database schema. This allows
                 automatic identification and extraction of key
                 information from a web using standard database
                 techniques. Such `lightweight' databases may span
                 servers, with searches being performed at client- or
                 server-side. We have applied this approach to
                 generating `flattened' versions of hypertext documents

                 targets, as well as the archive data products produced
                 by the PDS such as images, spectra, series, and qubes.

                 Specialists in administrative, systems, public, and
                 technical services alike recognize MARC as a standard
                 data storage format that has made it easier to produce,
                 store, and retrieve data. Few disagree that its
                 widespread adoption has enabled libraries to realize
                 the full benefits of automation. In this article, Kiser
                 explains why another technology, Standard Generalized
                 Markup Language, promises to have as powerful an impact
                 on the publishing industry as the MARC record has had
                 on libraries in terms of content, quality, cost, and

                 Internet, navigable via Web browsers. Web browsers

                 treated in HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) and

                 computer-mediated classrooms or labs can use HTML and
                 Web browsers to create multimedia presentations for
                 their classes. Files required for HTML, including text,
                 graphics, and other multimedia, are discussed. The
                 process involves using text files to create HTML
                 documents containing coding-embedded HTML commands.
                 HTML commands are the language used to mark up text to
                 make it interactive and ``pretty.'' The most common
                 HTML codes (``tags'') for making text pretty are listed

                 In addition to being easy to learn, additional tools
                 exist to simplify further the task of Web authoring.
                 Being the centerpiece of the networked publishing
                 system, HTML can be used to publish articles, journals
                 or books to documents and data in other formats. It
                 enables one to place related documents and multimedia
                 data within easy reach of readers.",

                 widely known and well understood. It is then surprising
                 that the standard techniques and tools prove to be of
                 limited use for searching structured text formatted
                 with SGML or similar markup languages. Our experience
                 with structured text search has caused us to reexamine
                 the current practice. The generally accepted rule of
                 ``leftmost longest match'' is an unfortunate choice and
                 is at the root of the difficulties. We instead propose
                 a rule which is semantically cleaner. This rule is
                 generally applicable to a variety of text search
                 applications, including source code analysis, and has
                 interesting properties in its own right. We have
                 written a publicly available search tool implementing
                 the theory in the article, which has proved valuable in
                 a variety of circumstances.",

                 rapidly becoming the standard file format for
                 transmitting 3D virtual worlds across the Internet.
                 Static and dynamic descriptions of 3D objects,
                 multimedia content, and a variety of hyperlinks can be
                 represented in VRML files. Both VRML browsers and
                 authoring tools for the creation of VRML files are
                 widely available for several different platforms.
                 Visually interesting VRML files tend to be large. In
                 this paper we describe our proposal for the VRML
                 Compressed Binary Format. Our proposal significantly
                 reduces file sizes and, subsequently, the time required
                 for transmission across the Internet. Compression
                 ratios of up to 50:1 or more are achieved for large
                 models. The format combines a binary encoding with
                 topologically-assisted compression algorithms to create
                 compact, rapidly-parsable VRML files. The format is
                 currently being evaluated by the Compressed Binary
                 Format Working Group of the VRML Consortium for
                 possible inclusion into the VRML Standard. The
                 compression scheme represents a polyhedron using two
                 interlocking trees: a spanning tree of vertices and a
                 spanning tree of triangles. The connectivity
                 information represented in other compact schemes, such
                 as triangular strips and generalized triangular meshes,
                 can be directly derived from this representation.
                 Connectivity information for large models is compressed
                 with storage requirements approaching one bit per
                 triangle. [sic] an average of roughly two bits per
                 triangle. A variable length, optionally lossy
                 compression technique is used for vertex positions,
                 normals, colors, and texture coordinates. The format
                 supports all VRML property binding conventions.",

                 of text-based data. We have developed a rendering
                 engine for HTML and XML documents, providing
                 rudimentary support for typography, but allowing easy
                 extensions (displets) for any kind of data, including
                 non-textual ones, such as math, charts, graphs, etc.
                 Some extensions have already been developed: here we
                 present the one for supporting Z, a notation for formal
                 specifications of software systems.",

  abstract =     "The World Wide Web (WWW) is a fast growing global
                 information resource. It contains an enormous amount of
                 information and provides access to a variety of
                 services. Since there is no central control and very
                 few standards of information organization or service
                 offering, searching for information and services is a
                 widely recognized problem. To some degree this problem
                 is solved by ``search services,'' also known as
                 ``indexers,'' such as Lycos, AltaVista, Yahoo, and
                 others. These sites employ search engines known as
                 ``robots'' or ``knowbots'' that scan the network
                 periodically and form text-based indices. These
                 services are limited in certain important aspects.
                 First, the structural information, namely, the
                 organization of the document into parts pointing to
                 each other, is usually lost. Second, one is limited by
                 the kind of textual analysis provided by the ``search
                 service.'' Third, search services are incapable of
                 navigating ``through'' forms. Finally, one cannot
                 prescribe a complex database-like search. We view the
                 WWW as a huge database. We have designed a high-level
                 SQL-like language called W3QL to support effective and
                 flexible query processing, which addresses the
                 structure and content of WWW nodes and their varied
                 sorts of data. We have implemented a system called W3QS
                 to execute W3QL queries. In W3QS, query results are
                 declaratively specified and continuously maintained as
                 views when desired. The current architecture of W3QS
                 provides a server that enables users to pose queries as
                 well as integrate their own data analysis tools. The
                 system and its query language set a framework for the
                 development of database-like tools over the WWW. A
                 significant contribution of this article is in
                 formalizing the WWW and query processing over it.",

                 the World Wide Web technology made an immense amount of
                 multimedia information available to the desktop. As a
                 natural consequence of this easy access to a global
                 information infrastructure, several Web co-browsing
                 systems have been recently introduced [1,5,9]. In such
                 systems, several participants join a conference during
                 which they navigate the Internet exploring its
                 resources together. In this paper, we present a shared
                 markup system that is designed specifically to support
                 Web co-browsing. Based on the Hyper-Text Markup
                 Language (HTML) [3], the markup system is interoperable
                 across different platforms and Web browsers. It allows
                 for online annotation, of shared HTML documents,
                 directly inside the browser's windows. The annotations
                 created by the markup system are realized using HTML
                 components that are composed dynamically. The
                 mechanisms used for controlling the browsers'
                 environments and synchronizing the views of the
                 participants to a consistent view are also
                 described.''",

                 ``28 May 1999.'' Abstract: ``We argue for an XML
                 encoding of FIPA Agent Communication Language (ACL),
                 and give an alpha version of it, called Agent
                 Communication Markup Language (ACML), which we have
                 implemented. The XML approach facilitates: (a)
                 developing/maintaining parsers, integrating with
                 WWW-world software engineering, and (b) the enriching
                 capability to (hyper-)link to ontologies and other
                 extra information. The XML approach applies similarly
                 to KQML as well. Motivated by the importance of the
                 content language aspect of agent communication, we
                 focus in particular on business rules as a form of
                 content that is important in e-commerce applications
                 such as bidding negotiations. A leading candidate
                 content language for business rules is Knowledge
                 Interchange Format (KIF), which is currently in the
                 ANSI standards committee process. We observe several
                 major practical shortcomings of KIF as a content
                 language for business rules in e-commerce. We argue
                 instead for a knowledge representation (KR) approach
                 based on Courteous Logic Programs (CLP) that overcomes
                 several of KIF's representational limitations, and
                 argue for this CLP approach, e.g., for its logical
                 non-monotonicity and its computational practicality.
                 CLP is a previous KR that expressively extends
                 declarative ordinary logic programs cf. Prolog; it
                 includes negation-as-failure plus prioritized conflict
                 handling. We argue for an XML encoding of business
                 rules content, and give an alpha version of it, called
                 Business Rules Markup Language (BRML), which we have
                 implemented. BRML can express both CLP and a subset of
                 KIF (i.e., of first-order logic) that overlaps with
                 CLP. BRML expressively both extends and complements
                 KIF. The overall advantages of an XML approach to
                 content language are similar to those for the XML
                 approach to ACL, and indeed complements the latter
                 since content is carried within ACL messages.''",

                 what does this book have to offer that the others
                 don't? How about a head-on approach written for Web
                 developers, starting with practical applications of XML
                 that you can use. If you're trying to get a grasp on
                 XML before it becomes a full-fledged industry standard,
                 JUST XML can be just the quick ticket you are looking
                 for. [John] Simpson's use of B-movie story lines makes
                 the XML lesson both interesting and informative, a
                 quality that's rare for such technical topics.'' ---
