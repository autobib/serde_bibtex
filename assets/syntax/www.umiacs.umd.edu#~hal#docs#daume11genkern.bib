    In this paper, we propose a family of kernels
    for the data distributions belonging to
    the exponential family. We call these kernels
    generative kernels because they take into
    account the generative process of the data.
    Our proposed method considers the geometry
    of the data distribution to build a set
    of efficient closed-form kernels best suited for
    that distribution. We compare our generative
    kernels on multinomial data and observe
    improved empirical performance across the
    board. Moreover, our generative kernels perform
    signicantly better when training size is
    small, an important property of the generative
    models.
