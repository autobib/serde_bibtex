% When entering into this citation database please:
%
%   - Check whether the entry you are putting in already exists
%   - Remember that multiple authors MUST have 'and' between them.
%     Otherwise BibTeX/InterBib will not understand that they're
%     looking at multiple names.
%   - Please don't use 'et al'. Put in all the authors.
%   - If you have a URL for the paper you're entering, please include
%     a 'links' field in the paper's entry. Just copy an existing one
%     and modify the URL. This will cause InterBib to link the title
%     of the paper to that URL when building an HTML
%     bibliography. Extremely nice.
%   - Check whether any of the string macros below are applicable.
%     and use them. For instance: cacm, icde98, ieeecomp, sigir96,

  ,abstract = {In a multi-party transaction such as fulfilling an
           information request from multiple sources (also called
           a distributed commerce transaction), agents face risks
           from dealing with untrusted agents. These risks are
           compounded in the face of deadlines, e.g., an agent may
           fail to deliver purchased goods by the time the goods
           are needed. We present a distributed algortihm that
           mitigates these risks, by generating a safe sequence of
           actions (when possible) that completes a commerce
           transaction with no risk. We show that the algorithm is
           sound (produces only safe multi-agent action sequences)
           and complete (finds a safe sequence whenever one
           exists). We also show how the algorithm may be extended
           so that agents may interact directly with other
           participants rather than through a trusted
           intermediary. }

can choose among
several competitive suppliers, but because of the nature of the
Internet, the reliability and trustworthiness of suppliers may vary
significantly.  The customer's goal is to maximize its utility, by
minimizing the expense required to fulfill its request, and maximizing
its probability of success by some deadline.  To this end, the
customer creates a request strategy, describing which suppliers to
contact under what conditions.  In this paper we describe models for
representing request strategies complete with supplier reliabilities,
delivery timeliness profiles, and customer deadlines.  We also develop
decision procedures for selecting request strategies that maximize
expected utility under certain scenarios, and more efficient
heuristics that approximate the optimal solution.}

to users change as
    they browse. We define a set of category-level operations that lets users
iteratively view
    and find results in terms of these changing category types. We also show
that we can
    express some standard IR operations as iteratively applied sequences of a
funda mental
    category-level operation (thus unifying them). Finally, we describe
SenseMaker, a
    prototype interface for browsing heteroge neous sources.}

reducing the initial
   latency of presentations, i.e., for reducing the time between the arrival of
a request and the
   start of the presentation. Traditionally, initial latency has not received
much attention. This is
   because one major application of multimedia servers is movies on demand where
a delay of
   a few minutes before a new multi-hour movie starts is acceptable. However ,
latency
   reduction is important in interactive applications such as video games and
browsing of
   multimedia documents. V arious latency reduction schemes are proposed and
analyzed,
   and their performance compared. We show that our techniques can signicantly
reduce
   (almost eliminate in some cases) initial latency without adversely affecting
throughput.
   Moreover , a novel on-disk partial data replication scheme that we propose
proves to be
   far more cost effective than any other previous attempts at reducing initial
latency.

               difficult in part because of the nonuniform query

               Boolean queries in one rich front-end language. For
               each user query and target source, we transform the
               user query into a subsuming query that can be supported
               by the source but that may return extra documents. The
               results are then processed by a filter query to yield
               the correct final results. In this article we introduce
               the architecture and associated mechanism for query
               translation. In particular, we discuss techniques for
               rewriting predicates in Boolean queries into native
               subsuming forms, which is a basis of translating
               complex queries. In addition, we present experimental
               results for evaluating the cost of postfiltering. We
               also discuss the drawbacks of this approach and cases
               when it may not be effective. We have implemented
               prototype versions of these mechanisms and demonstrated
               them on heterogeneous Boolean systems.}

        Abstract:  Describes an architecture called InterPay for allowing
heterogeneous payment mechanisms to interoperate.  Defines three levels (a task
level, payment policy level, and payment mechanism level) that may be modified
in

dependently.  Describes a working prototype using the ILU distributed object
system from Xerox.  Shows a sample transaction using the architecture, and how
the components of the architecture (payment agents, collection agents, and paym

ent and collection capabilities) can be used in more complex transactions.

               discover clusters of users that exhibit similar
               information needs; e.g., users that access similar
               pages. This may result in a better understanding of how
               users visit the site, and lead to an improved
               organization of the hypertext documents for
               navigational convenience. More interestingly, based on
               what categories an individual user falls into, we can
               dynamically suggest links for him to navigate. In this
               paper, we describe the overall design of a system that
               implements these ideas, and elaborate on the
               preprocessing, clustering, and dynamic link suggestion
               tasks. We present some experimental results generated
               by analyzing the access log of a web site. }

        Abstract:  Focusing primarily on intellectual property, this article
covers
a lot of ground.  Briefly describes the CNRI copyright management project,
argues for "permission headers" that describe how each of the various protected
rights (viewing, copying, preparing derivative works, etc) can be in the header,
along with economic information.  Describes whether digitally signed contracts
are likely to be legally enforceable (they probably are), and under what ci

rcumstances electronic records are court-admissable (when they are generated as
a regular course of business, and there's no reason to doubt them).  Argues
against general encryption, too expensive & inconsistent with the open market o

f ideas.  Seeks legal protection commensurate with the value of a transaction.

Economic discussion of publishing.  Looks at "first copy" and

first copy costs while still distributing to all for whom it is
economically rational (value is greater than incremental cost.)
Possible models: 1) "country club", where one pays high up-front dues,
but then low per-transaction cost; 2) "differentiated costs" where
different products are provided, one at a higher cost with certain
features, a second at lower (marginal) cost, e.g., more expensive
hardcover comes out first, followed by cheap paperback months later.
Mentions 3 specific examples:  Project Muse, Chicago Journal of Theoretical
Computer Science, and Mathematical Reviews.

        Abstract:  Argues that publishers and libraries will fill the same niche
in the digital library.  Both will have to change.  Talks about the Chicago
Journal of Theoretical CS, and says that MIT press is making the effort to cha

nge the perception of the online journal so it is considered as prestigious as a
traditional journal.  Worries that drained of traditional revenue sources,
publishers will charge much higher reprint fees.  Also concerned that there may

 be a patent in the pipeline that the Patent Office will stupidly allow, causing
major problems for the field.

        Abstract: Presents an approach for full persistence in hypertext
systems.  Not only are old versions kept around, but you can also start
modifications from any version.  Works by keeping information about each link--
the version

 number it was associated with, whether it's been updated, access rights,
whether it's part of an aggregation.  There is also a version tree which shows
which versions result from modifications from other versions.  Then, based on
the
version you're starting with and the preorder traversal of the version tree, the
system determines which links are "current" for you.  Some of the analysis (eg,
O(1) worst case per access step) seem suspect (it seems like you need to t

raverse the version tree), but interesting ideas.

for rights in "all media hereinafter discovered", something authors are wary of
giving away, esp. when many publishers aren't really in the position to exp

loit electronic rights.  How are royalties granted in the electronic age?
Should they be higher because costs are lower, or lower because of new costs of
transferring work?  Should the publisher have the right to sublicense?  Bottom l

               Audience: AI researchers, sociologists.
                References: .12
                Links: .
                Relevance: Low.
                Abstract:  Many information requests cannot be
                  answered via on-line resources, but must be answered
                  by a human expert.  Finding the right person is
                  hard, and usually works by contacting a friend or
                  friend of a friend.  This system is designed to
                  automatically generate chains of referrals--each
                  user encodes areas of expertise, and lists
                  colleagues who may be questioned.  The system
                  records all mail, incoming & outgoing, and uses that
                  to determine area of expertise of communicators,
                  storing an inverted index of the mail.  Then when a
                  question comes up, the system automatically selects
                  relevant people, and sends queries.  Their agents
                  intercept, and either route to user, send other
                  referrals, or delete.  Simulation results show
                  number of steps to answer for random graphs based on
                  accuracy and responsiveness of referrals.}

     ABSTRACT = {The popularity of on-line document databases has led to a
       new problem: finding which text databases (out or many candidate choices)
are
       the most relevant to a user. Identifying the relevant databases for a
given
       query is the text database discovery problem. The first part of this
paper
       presents a practical solution based on estimating the
       result size of a query and a database. The method is termed
       GLOSS-Glossary of Servers Server. The second part of this
       paper evaluates the effectiveness of GLOSS based on a trace
       of real user queries. In addition, we analyze the storage
       cost of our approach.}

address the issue of

     environment has the following components: users, information repositories,
information
     services, and payment mechanisms. This paper describes three of the
     heterogeneity-focused Stanford projects-InfoBus, REACH, and DLITE. The
InfoBus
     project is at the protocol level, while the REACH and DLITE projects are
both at the
     conceptual model level. The InfoBus project provides the infrastructure
necessary for
     accessing heterogeneous services and utilizing heterogeneous payment
mechanisms. The
     REACH project sets forth a uniform conceptual model for finding information
in
     networked information repositories. The DLITE project presents a general
task-based
     strategy for building user interfaces to heterogeneous networked
information services. }

             library, autonomous services and collections are accessed
             indirectly via proxies. To facilitate metadata
             compatibility and interoperability in such a digital
             library, we have designed a metadata architecture that
             includes four basic component classes: attribute model
             proxies, attribute model translators, metadata facilities
             for search proxies, and metadata repositories. Attribute
             model proxies elevate both attribute sets and the
             attributes they define to first-class objects. They also
             allow relationships among attributes to be captured.
             Attribute model translators map attributes and attribute
             values from one attribute model to another (where
             possible). Metadata facilities for search proxies provide
             structured descriptions both of the collections to which
             the search proxies provide access and of the search
             capabilities of the proxies. Finally, metadata repositories
             accumulate selected metadata from local instances of the
             other three component classes in order to facilitate global
             metadata queries and local metadata caching. In this paper,
             we outline further the roles of these component classes,
             discuss our design rationale, and analyze related work.}

                  a real example of an integrated network management
                  (INM) system. One of the major requirements when
                  looking at information transfer between the managed
                  network and the management system is to mask the
                  heterogeneity of the underlying resources. As an
                  example of the unification of heterogeneity
                  networks, a software called the Integrator has been
                  designed and implemented. The Integrator is a
                  mechanism that provides an object oriented interface
                  to the user (human or network management application
                  programs) to offer a homogeneous view of a world
                  (set of heterogeneous domains) through a model
                  (depicting a formal information view). The
                  Integrator uses two agents to communicate with
                  underlying network elements: an SNMP agent accessing
                  TCP/IP parameters for an Ethernet network through a
                  SNMP agent, and an X.25 interface program doing the
                  same for X.25 parameters through proprietary
                  management software. The concepts of the Integrator
                  has been applied in the EC project PEMMON}

                  judgments, and making correlations with other

                  adopting SGML technology to process them

  ,abstract = {A model is presented for converting a collection of
                  documents to hypertext by means of indexing.  The
                  documents are assumed to be semistructured, i.e.,
                  their text is a hierarchy of parts, and some of the
                  parts consist of natural language.  The model is
                  intended as a framework for specifying hypertextual
                  reading capabilities for specific application areas
                  and for developing new automated tools for the
                  conversion of semistructured text to hypertext.  In
                  the model, two well-known paradigms---formal
                  grammars and document indexing---are combined.  The
                  structure of the source text is defined by a schema
                  that is a constrained context-free grammar.  The
                  hierarchic structure of the source may thus be
                  modeled by a parse tree for the grammar.  The effect
                  of indexing is described by the grammar
                  transformations.  The new grammar, called an
                  indexing schema, is associated with a new parse tree
                  where some text parts are index elements.  The
                  indexing schema may hide some parts of the original
                  documents or the structure of some parts.  For
                  information retrieval, parts of the indexed text are
                  considered to be nodes of a hypergraph.  In the
                  hypergraph-based information access, the navigation
                  capabilities of hypertext systems are combined with
                  the querying capabilities of information retrieval
                  systems.}

                  the regulations and laws that discipline the life of
                  documents within a given application domain.  To
                  fulfill the requirements of such a sophisticated
                  retrieval, we propose a document retrieval model and
                  system based on the representation of knowledge
                  describing the semantic contents of documents, the
                  way in which the documents are managed by procedures
                  and by people in the office, and the application
                  domain where the office operates.  The article
                  describes the knowledge representation issues needed
                  for the document retrieval system and presents a
                  document retrieval model that captures these issues.
                  The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by
                  describing a system, named {\em Kabiria}, built on
                  top of such model.  The article describes the
                  querying and browsing environments, and the

                  query formulation and result browsing by supporting
                  cooperation between multiple users. In the
                  cooperative environment, three basic additional
                  operations are provided: copying, merging and
                  coupling for three types of TORI objects (query
                  forms, result forms, and query history
                  windows). Cooperation with query forms allows end
                  users to jointly formulate queries; cooperation with
                  result forms supports users in jointly browsing
                  through results and in sharing retrieved data
                  without re-accessing the database; cooperative use
                  of query histories yields a specific mechanism to
                  share "memory" between users. The implementation is
                  based on the concept of shared UI objects as an
                  application-independent cooperation and

                  however, often viewed with skepticism by the

                  oppressed workers performing rigidly-defined tasks
                  on an assembly line.  Although the potential for
                  abuse no doubt exists, workflow management can

                  fine-level of granularity, while still allowing

                  interface objects that need to be shared among users
                  are replicated. We discuss the design of DistView

    This is the paper that introduced RAIDs.  The paper proposes arrays
    of inexpensive disk as a cheaper, faster, and more scalable
    alternative to single large disk.  The problem is that an array of
    inexpensive disk has less reliability than a single large disk.
    The authors propose 5 levels of RAIDs to solve that problem.  Level
    1 uses mirrored disk, level 2 uses hamming code for ECC, level 3
    uses only a single check disk per group, level 4 allows independent
    reads/writes to the disks, level 5 distributes the check information
    across all disks.

    Update anywhere-anytime-anyway transactional replication has
unstable
    behavior as the workload scales up: a ten-fold increase in nodes and

    reduce this problem. A simple analytic model demonstrates these
    results. A new two-tier replication algorithm is proposed that
allows
    mobile (disconnected) applications to propose tentative update

   A remote backup database system tracks the state of a primary
   system, taking over transaction processing when disaster hits the
primary
   site. The primary and backup sites are physically isolated so that
failures
   at one site are unlikely to propagate to the other. For correctness,
the
   execution schedule at the backup must be equivalent to that at the
primary.
   When the primary and backup sites contain a single processor, it is
easy to
   achieve this property. However, this is harder to do when each site
contains
   multiple processors and sites are connected via multiple
communication
   lines. The authors present an efficient transaction processing
mechanism for
   multiprocessor systems that guarantees this and other important
properties.
   They also present a database initialization algorithm that copies the
   database to a backup site while transactions are being processed.

    This paper is perhaps too OS oriented.  Nevertheless is a great
paper.

    The paper presents a distributed file organization for
    record-structured, disk-resident files with key-based exact-match
    access.  The file is organized into buckets that are spread across
    multiple servers, where a server may hold multiple buckets. Client
    requests are serviced by mapping keys onto buckets and looking up
the
    corresponding server in an address table. Dynamic growth in terms of
    file size and access load is supported by bucket splits and bucket
    migration onto other existing or newly acquired servers. The
    significant and challenging problem addressed is how to achieve
    scalability so that both the file size and the client throughput can
    be scaled up by linearly increasing the number of servers and
    dynamically redistributing data. Unlike previous work with similar
    objectives, our data redistribution considers explicitly the
    cost/performance ratio of the system by aiming to minimize the
number
    of servers that are acquired to provide the required performance. A
    new server is acquired only if the overall server utilization in the
    system does not drop below a specified threshold. Preliminary
    simulation results show that the goal of scalability with controlled
    cost/performance is indeed achieved to a large extent.

    Detecting and extracting modifications from information sources is
an

    practice it is often necessary to infer modifications by
periodically
    comparing snapshots of data from the source. Although this snapshot
    differential problem is closely related to traditional joins and
    outerjoins, there are significant differences, which lead to simple
    new algorithms. In particular, we present algorithms that perform
    (possibly lossy) compression of records. We also present a window
    algorithm that works very well if the snapshots are not ``very
    different.'' The algorithms are studied via analysis and an
    implementation of two of them; the results illustrate the potential

                  We present a general framework to support the modeling
                  of digital documents and user queries in the context of
                  digital libraries (DL's). The basis of the framework is
                  a four-component model of a DL catalog involving a
                  document modeling component, a query modeling component,
                  a match component, and a catalog interoperability
                  component. Meta-information in such a catalog provides
                  models of library documents and facilitates efficient
                  access to information represented in the documents. In
                  particular, meta-information is conceptualized in terms
                  of sets of relations between nominal representations of
                  library documents and their properties, and sets of
                  relations between document properties. The properties of
                  the documents are modeled in meta-information in terms
                  of a multiplicity of languages which vary between the
                  catalog components and between catalogs. Each of the
                  catalog components is modeled in terms of a set of
                  formal systems related to the languages employed in the
                  component. Using this framework, we discuss the two
                  critical issues of catalog intraoperability and catalog
                  interoperability. The framework provides a basis both
                  for the rational design of meta-information and catalogs
                  in DL contexts, and for an analysis and resolution of
                  the intraoperability and interoperability issues. We
                  provide examples of the issues discussed in terms of the
                  Alexandria Digital Library.

  ,abstract = {
                  In a digital library system, documents are available in
                  digital form and therefore are more easily copied and
                  their copyrights are more easily violated. This is a
                  very serious problem, as it discourages owners of
                  valuable information from sharing it with authorized
                  users. There are two main philosophies for addressing
                  this problem: prevention and detection. The former
                  actually makes unauthorized use of documents difficult
                  or impossible while the latter makes it easier to
                  discover such activity. We propose a system for
                  registering documents and then detecting copies, either
                  complete copies or partial copies. We describe
                  algorithms for such detection, and metrics required for
                  evaluating detection mechanisms (covering accuracy,
                  efficiency, and security). We also describe a working
                  prototype, called COPS, describe implementation issues,
                  and present experimental results that suggest the proper
                  settings for copy detection parameters.

                  Secure methods of payment are needed before we will see
                  widespread commercial use of the Internet. Recently
                  proposed and implemented payment methods follow one of
                  three models: electronic currency, credit-debit, and
                  secure credit card transactions. Such payment services
                  have different strengths and weaknesses with respect to
                  the requirements of security, reliability, scalability,
                  anonymity, acceptability, customer base, flexibility,
                  convertibility, efficiency, ease of integration with
                  applications, and ease of use. NetCheque is a payment
                  system based on the credit-debit model. NetCheque is
                  described and its strengths with respect to these
                  requirements are discussed.

               collaborations including communicating, structuring, sharing
               information, and organizing people. Grassroots is a system
               that provides a uniform framework to support people's
               collaborative activities mediated by collections of
               information. The system seamlessly integrates
               functionalities currently found in such disparate systems as
               e-mail, newsgroups, shared hotlists, hierarchical indexes,
               hypermail, etc. Grassroots co-exists with these systems in
               that its users benefit from the uniform image provided by
               Grassroots, but other people can continue using other
               mechanisms, and Grassroots leverages from them. The current
               Grassroots prototype is based on an http-proxy
               implementation, and can be used with any Web browser. In the
               context of the design of a next-generation version of the
               Web, Grassroots demonstrates the utility of a uniform
               notification infrastructure. }

               translators, metadata facilities for search proxies, and
               metadata repositories. Attribute model proxies elevate both
               attribute sets and the attributes they define to first-class
               objects. They also allow relationships among attributes to
               be captured. Attribute model translators map attributes and
               attribute values from one attribute model to another (where
               possible). Metadata facilities for search proxies provide
               structured descriptions both of the collections to which the
               search proxies provide access and of the search capabilities
               of the proxies. Finally, metadata repositories accumulate
               selected metadata from local instances of the other three
               component classes in order to facilitate global metadata
               queries and local metadata caching. In this paper, we
               outline further the roles of these component classes,
               discuss our design rationale, and analyze related work. }

  ,abstract = {In a digital library, there are many different interaction
               models between customers and information providers or
               merchants. Subscriptions, sessions, pay-per-view, shareware,
               and pre-paid vouchers are different models that each have
               different properties. A single merchant may use several of
               them. Yet if a merchant wants to support multiple models,
               there is a substantial amount of work to implement each
               one. In this paper, we formalize the shopping models which
               represent these different modes of consumer to merchant
               interaction. In addition to developing the overall
               architecture, we define the application program interfaces
               (API) to interact with the models. We show how a small
               number of primitives can be used to construct a wide range
               of shopping models that a digital library can support, and
               provide examples of the shopping models in operation,
               demonstrating their flexibility. }

               interaction, which has been referred to as indirect
               management. Instead of user-initiated interaction via
               commands and or direct manipulation, the user is engaged in
               a cooperative process in which human and computer agents
               both initiate communication, monitor events and perform
               tasks. The metaphor used is that of a personal assistant who
               is collaborating with the user in the same work
               environment. The assistant becomes gradually more effective

               and fulfilling tasks personally. This article focuses on a
               novel approach to building interface agents. It presents
               results from several prototype agents that have been built
               using this approach, including agents that provide
               personalized assistance with meeting scheduling, e-mail

               artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide

               application. The paper discusses an interface agent which
               has been modeled closely after the metaphor of a personal
               assistant. The agent learns how to assist the user by (i)
               observing the user`s actions and imitating them. (ii)
               Receiving user feedback when it takes wrong action. (iii)
               Being trained by the user on the basis of hypothetical
               examples and (iv) learning from other agents that assist
               other users with the same task. The paper discusses how this
               learning agent was implemented using memory-based learning

             has resulted in a need for tools that automatically
             classify new documents within such hierarchies. One can use
             existing classifiers by ignoring the hierarchical
             structure, treating the topics as separate classes.
             Unfortunately, in the context of text categorization, we
             are faced with a large number of classes and a huge number
             of relevant features needed to distinguish between them.
             Consequently, we are restricted to using only very simple
             classifiers, both because of computational cost and the
             tendency of complex models to overfit. We propose an
             approach that utilizes the hierarchical topic structure to
             decompose the classification task into a set of simpler
             problems, one at each node in the classification tree. As
             we show, each of these smaller problems can be solved
             accurately by focusing only on a very small set of
             features, those relevant to the task at hand. This set of
             relevant features varies widely throughout the hierarchy,
             so that, while the overall relevant feature set may be
             large, each classifier only examines a small subset. The
             use of reduced feature sets allows us to utilize more
             complex (probabilistic) models, without encountering the
             computational and robustness difficulties described above.}

             Client-side web applications, on the other hand, provide
             excellent interactivity at the expense of limited access to
             server resources. The WebWriter II Editor, a direct

             both server-side and client-side processing in order to
             achieve the advantages of both. In particular, this editor
             downloads the document data structure to the browser and
             performs all operations locally. The user interface is
             based on HTML frames and includes individual frames for
             previewing the document and displaying general and specific
             control panels. All editing is done by JavaScript code

                  aims to show that collaboration is an important
                  aspect of searching online information stores that
                  requires explicit computerised support. The claim is
                  made that a truly user-centred system must
                  acknowledge and support collaborative interactions
                  between users. Collaborative working implies a need
                  to share information: both the search product and
                  the search process. Searches need not be restricted
                  to inanimate resources but people can also search
                  for other people. The ARIADNE system is introduced
                  as an example of computerised support for
                  collaboration between browsers. A number of systems
                  offering varied approaches to supporting
                  collaboration are surveyed and a structure for
                  analysing the various aspects of collaboration is
                  applied.  }

               We describe an extensible constructor tool that helps
               information experts (e.g., librarians) create
               specialized query synthesizers for heterogeneous
               digital-library environments. A query synthesizer
               provides a graphical user interface in which a
               digital-library patron can specify a high-level,
               fielded, multi-source query. Furthermore, a query
               synthesizer interacts with a query translator and an
               attribute translator to transform high-level queries
               into sets of source-specific queries. We discuss how
               the constructor can facilitate discovery of available
               attributes (e.g., title), collation of schemas from
               different sources, selection of input widgets for a
               synthesizer (e.g., a text box or a drop-down list
               widget to support input of controlled vocabulary), and
               other design aspects. We also describe a prototype
               constructor we implemented, based on the Stanford
               InfoBus and metadata architecture.}

               digital objects, functional layering of services, the

in both frequency and spatial domains to reduce the chance that
adjacent DCT blocks lose the same frequency components. The image
reconstruction takes into consideration the spatial characteristics
represented by the frequency components. Combining these two approaches
is able to reconstruct the damaged images more accurately, even under
very high loss rates. In addition, since the reconstruction technique is
computational efficient, it conserves system resources and power
consumption, which are restrictive in mobile computers.}

                  gradual and incremental. The iKP protocols are presented
                  herein with the intention to serve as a starting point for
                  eventual standards on secure electronic payment.}

  ,abstract = {"Cryptography can be useful to send yourself a message via an
                  untrusted intermediary. Pushing the cost of storing
                  infrequently accessed information off to the client allows
                  the servers to run quickly: the network acts as a perfect
                  prefetch unit for loading your memory with the necessary
                  state for the next operation. By way of example, a server
                  that has to store a lot of information about subscribers
                  might buckle under the seek time of accessing subscriber
                  records. Pushing it off to clients allows us to have the
                  salient parts of the database arrive in memory precisely when
                  needed, at the small cost of verifying that the information
                  hasnt been tampered with. A service can help aggregate the
                  transactions into a grain large enough to be acceptable to
                  more conventional transaction handlers, without providing
                  complete information about the transaction to the service. By
                  making fund transfer explicit in each retrieval, all parties
                  involved can instantly tell when theyre being cheated; by
                  limiting the scale of transaction, consumers can control the
                  level of risk they accept."}

                  from European industry, financial institutions, and academia
                  has embarked on a research project to develop the
                  fundamentals of secure electronic commerce. The goal of the
                  ACTS Project SEMPER (Secure Electronic Marketplace for
                  Europe) is to provide the first open and comprehensive
                  solution for secure commerce over the Internet and other
                  public information networks. SEMPER's flexible open
                  architecture is based on a model of electronic commerce which
                  comprehends a business scenario as a sequence of transfers
                  and fair exchanges of "business items", which are payments,
                  data, or rights. This is reflected in the architecture: The
                  exchange and transfer layer handles transfers and fair
                  exchanges of items. The commerce layer provides methods for
                  downloading certified commerce services and the necessary
                  trust management. The commerce services implement the terms
                  of business of a seller using the exchange and transfer layer
                  services. A prototype of this architecture implemented in the
                  Java programming language will be trialed for sales of
                  multimedia courseware (EUROCOM, Athens, GR), on-line
                  consultancy and subscriptions (FOGRA, Munchen, D) as well as
                  mail-order retailing (Otto-Versand, Hamburg, D). It will
                  integrate the payment systems SET (provided by IBM), Chipper
                  (provided by KPN Research), and ecash (provided by DigiCash).
                  The prototype uses a distinguished user-interface for
                  trustworthy user in- and output which enables to use SEMPER
                  on secure hardware." }

                  translation to resolve differences between multiple data
                  sources and the multiple applications for the collected data.
                  Infomaster connects to a variety of databases using wrappers,
                  such as for Z39.50, SQL databases through ODBC, EDI
                  transactions, and other World Wide Web (WWW) sources. There
                  are several WWW user interfaces to Infomaster, including
                  forms based and textual. Infomaster also includes a
                  programmatic interface and it can download results in
                  structured form onto a client computer. Infomaster has been
                  in production use for integrating rental housing
                  advertisements from several newspapers (since fall 1995), and
                  for meeting room scheduling (since winter 1996). Infomaster

                  concurrency and recovery solutions must be revisited to
                  capture the movement behavior. As an effort in this
                  direction, we define a model of mobile transactions by
                  building on the concepts of split transactions and global
                  transactions in a multidatabase environment. Our view of
                  mobile transactions, called kangaroo transactions,
                  incorporates the property that transactions in a mobile
                  computing system hop from one base station to another as the
                  mobile unit moves through cells. Our model is the first to
                  capture this movement behavior as well as the data behavior
                  which reflects the access to data located in databases
                  throughout the static network. The mobile behavior is dynamic
                  and is realized in our model via the use of split operations.
                  The data access behavior is captured by using the idea of
                  global and local transactions in a multidatabase system."

                  that delivers messages among mobile hosts.  This

                  in an order consistent with their causality, which
                  is important in applications that involve human
                  interaction such as mobile e-mail and mobile

                  zippering. When the client connects with the
                  application, communication between the client and
                  the application is synchronous. When the client
                  intermittently connects with the application,
                  communication becomes asynchronous. The DIANA
                  (Device-Independent, Asynchronous Network Access)
                  approach allows the client to perform a variety of
                  operations while disconnected. Finally, when the
                  client reconnects with the application, the
                  operations performed independently on the client are
                  replayed to the application in the order they were
                  originally done. Zippering allows the user at the
                  client to fix errors detected during reconciliation
                  and continues the transaction gracefully instead of
                  aborting the whole transaction when errors are

                  important, especially for battery operated systems. Displays,
                  disks, and CPUs, in that order, use the most energy. Reducing
                  the energy used by displays and disks has been studied
                  elsewhere; this paper considers a new method for reducing the
                  energy used by the CPU. We introduce a new metric for CPU
                  energy performance, millions-of-instructions-per-joule
                  (MIPJ). We examine a class of methods to reduce MIPJ that are
                  characterized by dynamic control of system clock speed by the
                  operating system scheduler. Reducing clock speed alone does
                  not reduce MIPJ, since to do the same work the system must
                  run longer. However, a number of methods are available for
                  reducing energy with reduced clock-speed, such as reducing
                  the voltage (Chandrakasan et al., 1992) (Horowitz, 1993) or
                  using reversible (Younis and Knight, 1993) or adiabatic logic
                  (Athas et al., 1994). What are the right scheduling
                  algorithms for taking advantage of reduced clock-speed,
                  especially in the presence of applications demanding ever
                  more instructions-per-second? We consider several methods for
                  varying the clock speed dynamically under control of the
                  operating system, and examine the performance of these
                  methods against workstation traces. The primary result is
                  that by adjusting the clock speed at a fine grain,
                  substantial CPU energy can be saved with a limited impact on
                  performance."

                  number of packets sent or received by a particular transport
                  protocol but the amount of time that the NI is in an active

  abstract =       "Mobile computing is now at the stage where cell
                  phones were 5-7 years ago. Laptops are frequently
                  the choice of telecommuters who put in significant
                  amounts of time both at home and at the office, but
                  there is a growing group of mobile users who work
                  from more than two locations and who expect to
                  perform their full job responsibilities using a
                  laptop that rarely returns to the main
                  office. Although a mobile PC can be used without
                  ever connecting to a network, they are typically
                  connected with or without wires. Wired systems are
                  most common and generally use modems with the
                  dial-up lines found in homes or hotels. Wireless
                  connections are increasing in popularity and use
                  cellphone-like radio links to send and receive
                  information, but mobile computing is not just about
                  wireless connections; it is also about using your
                  laptop in a hotel (in any country), at home, in a
                  branch office or at a customer site. Using a laptop
                  in those locations frequently reduces your
                  interaction speed and range of functions to an
                  unacceptable level, but recent improvements have
                  attacked these problems. To really feel the freedom
                  offered by mobile computing, imagine setting up
                  overseas in your customer's spare office and working
                  as if you were in your own office.  Imagine being in
                  a foreign country and not having to load printer
                  drivers for each printer and load US fonts for each
                  job in order to produce properly printed output. If
                  this sort of future appeals to you, you're not
                  alone. A likely and growing group is people who
                  already use laptops. In 1996, laptops comprised
                  30-35% of new PCs sold, and in 1997, 72 million PCs
                  are forecast to be manufactured."

                  location and time of access.  The paper describes a
                  framework for location dependent information
                  service, called the mobile object model. In the
                  mobile object model, a service consists of objects
                  that contain both information and functions. These
                  objects, called mobile objects, are managed as
                  distributed objects. Mobile objects are recomposed
                  to a composite object according to user status
                  dynamically. This composite object is then executed
                  to realize location-dependent information service.

                  transmission and the amount of CPU power used by the

                  Companion: a wireless hand-held computer. A helper
                  program as proposed in this paper is a service
                  program that can migrate once from a server to a
                  Pocket Companion or vice-versa. A helper program is
                  convenient, provides environment awareness and
                  allows asynchronous interaction. Moreover helpers
                  can be used to save processing power and to reduce
                  communication. By migrating to the location of a
                  resource, a helper can access the resource more
                  efficiently. This is particularly attractive for
                  mobile computing, where the network conditions can
                  be poor and unreliable, and because it does not
                  require a permanent connectivity. Security is a
                  significant concern for helpers, as the user of a
                  Pocket Companion receiving a piece of code for
                  execution may require strong assurances about the
                  helper's behaviour. The best way to achieve a high
                  security is to use a combination of several
                  methods. We are designing a prototype of a helper
                  system, called Harpoon, on top of the Inferno
                  operating system."

                  and medical information systems (MIS). In our academic FHC
                  (Family Health Center), we have developed software that runs
                  on a palmtop computer allowing access to information in the
                  hospital information system and our FHC's AAMRS (Automated
                  Ambulatory Medical Record System). Using a Hewlett-Packard
                  95LX palmtop computer, custom software has been developed to
                  access summary data on in-patients and out-patients. Data is
                  downloaded into a database on a palmtop computer memory card.
                  ASCII data from a MIS is transformed into a database format
                  readable on the palmtop. Our hospital MIS department
                  transmits information daily on our in-patient service. We
                  also download, weekly, a patient summary on all of our active
                  out-patients in our MUMPS-based AAMRS. Each morning, the
                  resident in the Family Practice program updates his palmtop
                  memory card at a central workstation. We have made the
                  palmtop computer even more valuable to physicians by
                  providing an integrated software package. This package
                  includes information management software with to-do lists,
                  reference software such as drug formularies and decision
                  support software. The downloading of patient information
                  creates two important problems: security and reliability. To
                  assure the confidentiality of downloaded patient information,
                  the palmtop system uses password protection."

                  have been slow to adapt to the emergence of a global digital
                  medium, but there are now signs that a great deal of
                  information will be delivered online. However, digital
                  publishing on the Internet with services for libraries will
                  be a driving force in creating the global digital medium. One
                  issue that will become increasingly relevant is how the
                  individual user accesses rich multimedia data in the most
                  appropriate way. The digital university campus and the
                  digital library are becoming important concepts, with the aim
                  that users of information services will receive information
                  online supported by a ubiquistructure' of IT. For the digital
                  campus, this means that scholarly and teaching activities are
                  based on interactive access to information, and that the
                  digital bookshop and the digital classroom are becoming
                  possible with the development of 140 Mb/s SuperJANET links.
                  However, libraries will not be truly digital for the
                  foreseeable future, and they will maintain traditional and
                  digital media side by side. We look at the digital library
                  and the digital campus from the perspective of the individual
                  user and his information needs. We are particularly
                  interested in the use of small, mobile computers as access
                  points to the global digital medium. In an environment of
                  change (where the traditional campus and library exist
                  alongside the digital campus and library), the most
                  appropriate form of access technology is based on personal
                  technology, which allows linking between digital information
                  and traditional paper-based information."

                One of the most effective channels for disseminating
                  information and expertise within an organization is its
                  informal social network of collaborators, colleagues and
                  friends. Manually searching for a referral chain can be a
                  frustrating and time-consuming task. One is faced with the
                  trade-off of contacting a large number of individuals at each
                  step, and thus straining both the time and goodwill of the
                  possible respondents, or of contacting a smaller, more
                  focused set, and being more likely to fail to locate an
                  appropriate expert. In response to these problems, we are
                  building ReferralWeb, an interactive system for
                  reconstructing, visualizing and searching social networks on
                  the World Wide Web. Simulation experiments we ran before we
                  began construction of ReferralWeb showed that automatically
                  generated referrals can be highly successful in locating
                  experts in a large network.

                  collaborative filtering of netnews, to help people find
                  articles they will like in the huge stream of available
                  articles. News reader clients display predicted scores and
                  make it easy for users to rate articles after they read them.
                  Rating servers, called Better Bit Bureaus, gather and
                  disseminate the ratings. The rating servers predict scores
                  based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past
                  will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by
                  entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the
                  effectiveness of the score prediction. The entire
                  architecture is open: alternative software for news clients
                  and Better Bit Bureaus can be developed independently and can
                  interoperate with the components we have developed.

                  looking for information should be able to make use of what

                  collaborative filtering systems provide tools for readers to

                  interesting documents actively send "pointers" to those
                  documents to their colleagues. A "pointer" contains a

                  diverse data space. However, current information filtering
                  technology heavily depends on a user's active participation
                  for describing his interest in information items, forcing him
                  to accept an extra load to overcome the already loaded
                  situation. Furthermore, because the user's interests are
                  often expressed in a discrete format, such as a set of
                  keywords, sometimes augmented with if-then rules, it is
                  difficult to express ambiguous interests, which users often

                  monitoring to transparently capture the user's information
                  interests, and a technique to use these interests to filter
                  incoming information in a very efficient way. It is verified
                  by conducting a field experiment and a series of simulations
                  that the proposed techniques perform very well.

ecosystem where the agents evolve, compete and collaborate is presented:
agents that are useful to the user or other agents reproduce while low-

makes it possible on future occasions, when the objects are used
again, to display graphical abstractions of the accrued histories as
parts of the objects themselves. For example, co-authors of a
report can see stable and unstable sections (lines of text are
marked by recency of changes or amount of editing) and identify
who has written what and when. In the case of reading
documentation, a reader can see who else has previously read a
particular section of interest. While using a spreadsheet to refine a
budget, the count of edits per spreadsheet cell can be mapped onto
grayscale to give an impression of which budget numbers have
been reworked the most and least. Or in the context of learning
unfamiliar menu selections in a new piece of software, the menu
itself can depict the distribution statistics of colleagues' previous
menu selections in the same or similar contexts. There are many
existing computational devices that hint at the prospect of
history-enriched digital objects. Automatic change-bars, citation
indices, and download counts on computer bulletin boards are
examples. In fact, for the last thirteen years, members of our lab
have been able to request AP News articles by specifying a
minimum number of previous readers and thus easily retrieve
articles that colleagues have chosen to read.

    systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink
    database of at least 24 million pages is available at
    http://google.stanford.edu/
           To engineer a search engine is a challenging task.
    Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of
    web pages involving a comparable number of distinct
    terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every
    day. Despite the importance of large-scale search
    engines on the web, very little academic research has
    been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance
    in technology and web proliferation, creating a web
    search engine today is very different from three years
    ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of
    our large-scale web search engine -- the first such
    detailed public description we know of to date.
           Apart from the problems of scaling traditional
    search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are
    new technical challenges involved with using the
    additional information present in hypertext to
    produce better search results. This paper addresses
    this question of how to build a practical large-scale
    system which can exploit the additional information
    present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of
    how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext
    collections where anyone can publish anything they

 ,abstract = {The creation of a complex web site is a thorny
problem in user interface design. First, differnt
visitors have distinct goals. Second, even
a single visitor may have different needs at
different times. Much of the information at the
site may also be dynamic or time-dependent.
Third, as the site grows and evolves, its original
design may no longer be appropriate. Finally,
a site may be designed for a particular purpose
but used in unexpected ways.
Web servers record data about user interactions
and accumulate this data over time. We believe
that AI techniques can be used to examine
user access logs in order to automatically
improve the site. We challenge the AI community
to create adaptive web sites: sites that
automatically improve their organization and
presentation based on user access data.
Several unrelated research projects in plan
recognition, machine learning, knowledge representation,
and user modeling have begun to
explore aspects of this problem. We hope that
posing this challenge explicitly will bring these
projects together and stimulate fundamental
AI research. Success would have a broad and
highly visible impact on the web and the AI
community.

 ,abstract = {The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem
              user interface design. In IJCAI '97, we challenged
              the AI community to address this problem by
              creating adaptive web sites: sites that automatically
              improve their organization and presentation by min-
              ing visitor access data collected in Web server logs.
              In this paper we introduce our own approach to this
              broad challenge. Specifically, we investigate the problem
              of index page synthesis --- the automatic creation
              of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Web site.
              First, we formalize this problem as a clustering problem
              and introduce a novel approach to clustering,
              which we call cluster mining: Instead of attempting to
              partition the entire data space into disjoint clusters,
              we search for a small number of cohesive (and possibly
              overlapping) clusters. Next, we present PageGather,
              a cluster mining algorithm that takes Web server logs
              as input and outputs the contents of candidate index
              pages. Finally, we show experimentally that Page-Gather
              is both faster (by a factor of three) and more
              effective than traditional clustering algorithms on this
              task. Our experiment relies on access logs collected
              over a month from an actual web site. }

of
                  smart cellular phones and handheld wireless devices is
                  widening an already large gap between Internet clients.
                  Clients vary in their hardware resources, software
                  sophistication, and quality of connectivity, yet server
                  support for client variation ranges from relatively poor to
                  none at all. In this paper we introduce some design
                  principles that we believe are fundamental to providing
                  "meaningful" Internet access for the entire range of clients.
                  In particular, we show how to perform on-demand
                  datatype-specific lossy compression on semantically typed
                  data, tailoring content to the specific constraints of the
                  client. We instantiate our design principles in a proxy
                  architecture that further exploits typed data to enable
                  application-level management of scarce network resources. Our
                  proxy architecture generalizes previous work addressing all
                  three aspects of client variation by applying well-understood
                  techniques in a novel way, resulting in quantitatively better
                  end-to-end performance, higher quality display output, and

                  over bandwidth that may be scarce and expensive (e.g. a
                  metered cellular phone service). (2) Transcoding to a

                  improve rendering on the client or result in a representation
                  that can be transmitted more efficiently. (3) Knowledge of
                  client display constraints allows content to be optimized for

                  operates in indoor environments and supports a high density

                  techniques to provide the high-bandwidth connectivity,
                  portability, and user interface needed for this environment.

                  additional computational resources available on the servers.

               full-length text collections. This paper argues for
               making use of text structure when retrieving from full
               text documents, and presents a visualization paradigm,
               called TileBars, that demonstrates the usefulness of
               explicit term distribution information in Boolean-type
               queries. TileBars simultaneously and compactly indicate
               relative document length, query term frequency, and
               query term distribution. The patterns in a column of
               TileBars can be quickly scanned and deciphered, aiding
               users in making judgments about the potential relevance
               of the retrieved documents. }

engines know which pages users frequently visit. 'Web

               database describing Web page download times and users'
               page traversal patterns. The database can then be used
               for data mining or for suggesting popular or relevant
               pages to other users. We implemented three Web tracking
               systems, and compared their performance. In the first
               system, rather than connecting directly to Web sites, a
               client issues URL requests to a proxy. The proxy
               connects to the remote server and returns the data to
               the client, keeping a log of all transactions. The
               second system uses "sniffers" to log all HTTP traffic
               on a subnet. The third system periodically collects
               browser log files and sends them to a central
               repository for processing. Each of the systems differs
               in its advantages and pitfalls. We present a comparison
               of these techniques.}

 ,abstract = {As part of the Illinois Digital Library Initiative (DLI) project
we developed "scalable semantics" technologies. These statistical
techniques enabled us to index large collections for
deeper search than word matching. Through the auspices of
the DARPA Information Management program, we are developing
an integrated analysis environment, the Interspace
Prototype, that uses "semantic indexing" as the foundation
for supporting concept navigation. These semantic indexes
record the contextual correlation of noun phrases, and are
computed generically, independent of subject domain.

Using this technology, we were able to compute semantic indexes
for a subject discipline. In particular, in the summer
of 1998, we computed concept spaces for 9.3M MEDLINE
bibliographic records from the National Library of Medicine
(NLM) which extensively covered the biomedical literature
for the period from 1966 to 1997. In this experiment, we
first partitioned the collection into smaller collections (repositories)
by subject, extracted noun phrases from titles and
abstracts, then performed semantic indexing on these subcollections
by creating a concept space for each repository.
The computation required 2 days on a 128-node SGI/CRAY
Origin 2000 at the National Center for Supercomputer Ap-
plications (NCSA). This experiment demonstrated the feasibility
of scalable semantics techniques for large collections.
With the rapid increase in computing power, we believe this
indexing technology will shortly be feasible on personal computers.}

the filtering of thousands of information sources.
As the number and variety of sources increases, new
ways of automatically summarizing, discovering, and

Pharos is a highly scalable distributed architecture for
locating heterogeneous information sources. Its design
is hierarchical, thus allowing it to scale well as the number
of information sources increases. We demonstrate
the feasibility of the Pharos architecture using 2500
Usenet newsgroups as separate collections. Each newsgroup
is summarized via automated Library of Congress
classification. We show that using Pharos as an intermediate
retrieval mechanism provides acceptable accuracy
of source selection compared to selecting sources
using complete classification information, while maintaining
good scalability. This implies that hierarchical
distributed metadata and automated classification
are potentially useful paradigms to address scalability
problems in large-scale distributed information retrieval
applications.}

society at large. One implication for digital library (DL)
research is that we should start looking at projects that span the
spectrum from basic computer science to the implementation of
working systems and consider links among findings on
information system use from a variety of arenas in life. In this
paper, I integrate findings from my research on people's
encounters with DLs in two different arenas: academia and low-income
neighborhoods. The point is to see how concepts and
conclusions related to use do, in fact, cross these arenas. The
paper also aims to help bring results from studies of local
community information practices into the realm of DLs, since
community networking represents one particular genre and
audience that has not yet received a great deal of attention from
those engaged in DL research. Beginning with a discussion of
DL use as an "assemblage" of infrastructure, norms, knowledge,
and practice, the paper explores a number of insights gleaned
from user studies associated with two separate research projects:
1) the recently completed University of Illinois Digital
Libraries Initiative (DLI) project; and 2) the Community
Networking Initiative (CNI) currently in progress under the
auspices of the University of Illinois, the Urban League of
Champaign County and Prairienet, the community network
serving East Central Illinois. Insights about DL use discussed
in this paper include: the way in which trivial barriers are
magnified until they effectively cut off use on a large scale; the
difficulties faced by "outsiders" whose information worlds are
impoverished, the primacy of comfort and relevant content in
encouraging use; and the importance of informal social
networks for providing help related to system use.}

`We describe a method for automatically introducing topic-based

Automatic keyphrase extraction is exploited to identify link
anchors, and keyphrase-based similarity measures are used to
select and rank destinations. Two implementations are described:
one that applies these techniques to existing WWW-based digital
library collections using standard HTML, and one that uses a
wider range of interface techniques to provide more sophisticated
linking capabilities. An evaluation shows that keyphrase-based
similarity measures work as well as a popular full-text retrieval
system for finding relevant destination documents.}

information about Web resources and server

changes compared with the resource type. In
addition, we gather response header information reported by the servers
with each retrieved resource. Results from
the work indicate that there is potential to
reuse more cached resources than is currently being realized due to
inaccurate and nonexistent cache directives.
In terms of implications for caching, the
relationships between resources used to
compose a page must be considered. Embedded
images are often reused, even in pages that change frequently. This result
both points to the need to cache such images
and to discard them when they are no longer included as part of any page.
Finally, while the results show that HTML
resources frequently change, these changes
can be in a predictable and localized manner. Separating out the dynamic
portions

to modified Web pages.
Support for providing links to/from parts of non-HTML data, such
as sound and movie, will be possible via interfaces to plug-ins and
Java-based media players. The hypermedia structures are stored in a hypermedia
database, developed from the Devise Hypermedia framework, and the service is
available on the Web via an ordinary URL. The best user interface for
creating and manipulating the structures is currently provided for the
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x browser through COM integration that utilizes
the
Explorer's DOM representation of Web-pages. But the structures
can also be manipulated
and used via special Java applets and a pure proxy server solution is provided
for users who only need to browse the structures. A user can create and use
the external structures as `transparency' layers on top of arbitrary Web pages,
the

and the readability of such a language eases
its exploitation, presentation and direct insertion within a document (thus
also avoiding information duplication). We
advocate the use of Conceptual Graphs and simpler notational variants that
enhance knowledge readability. To further ease
the representation process, we propose techniques allowing users to leave
some knowledge terms undeclared. We also show
how lexical, structural and knowledge-based techniques may be combined

overloaded and unresponsive. The TCP listen
queue of the server's socket overflows exhibiting a drop-tail behavior. As a
result, clients experience service outages.
Since clients typically issue multiple requests over the duration of a
session with the server, and since requests are
dropped indiscriminately, all clients
connecting to the server at overload are likely
to experience connection failures, even though
there may be enough capacity on the server to deliver all responses properly

studies
identified mirroring, that is, the systematic
replication of content over a pair of hosts, as
the principal cause of duplication, but did not further investigate this
phenomenon. The main aim of this paper is to
present a clearer picture of mirroring
on the Web. As input we used a set of 179
million URLs found during a Web crawl done in
the summer of 1998. We looked at all hosts with more than 100 URLs in
our input (about 238,000), and discovered that
about 10% were mirrored to varying degrees. The paper presents data about
the prevalence of mirroring based on a
mirroring classification scheme that we define. There are numerous reasons for
mirroring: technical (e.g., to improve access
time), commercial (e.g., different intermediaries offering the same products),
cultural (e.g., same content in two languages),
social (e.g.. sharing of research data). and so forth. Although we have not done
a exhaustive study of the causes of replication, we discuss and provide
examples for several representative cases. Our
technique for detecting mirrored hosts from
large sets of collected URLs depends mostly on the syntactic analysis of URL
strings, and requires retrieval and content
analysis only for a small number of pages. We are able to detect both
partial and total mirroring, and handle cases
where the content is not byte-wise identical. Furthermore, our technique is
computationally very efficient and does not
assume that the initial set of URLs gathered from each host is comprehensive.
Hence, this approach has practical uses beyond our study, and can be applied in
other settings. For instance, for Web crawlers
and caching proxies, detecting mirrors can be
valuable to avoid redundant fetching. and knowledge of mirroring can be
used to compensate for broken links.}

 ,abstract = {The rapid growth of the World-Wide Web poses
unprecedented scaling challenges for general-purpose
crawlers and search engines. In this paper we describe a new
hypertext resource discovery system called a
Focused Crawler. The goal of a focused crawler is to selectively seek out
pages that are relevant to a pre-defined set of topics. The topics are specified
not using keywords, but using exemplary documents. Rather than collecting and
indexing
all accessible Web documents to be able to answer all possible ad-hoc queries,
a focused crawler analyzes its crawl boundary
to find the links that are likely to be most relevant for the crawl, and avoids
irrelevant regions of the Web. This leads to
significant savings in hardware
and network resources, and helps keep the crawl
more up-to-date. To achieve such goal-directed crawling, we
designed two hypertext mining programs that
guide our crawler: a classifier that evaluates the relevance of a hypertext
document with respect to the focus topics, and
a distiller that identifies hypertext
nodes that are great access points to many
relevant pages within a few links. We report on
extensive focused-crawling experiments using several topics at different
levels of specificity. Focused crawling acquires relevant pages steadily while
standard crawling quickly loses its way, even
though they are started from the same root set.
Focused crawling is robust against large perturbations in the starting set
of URLs. It discovers largely overlapping sets
of resources in spite of these perturbations. It is also capable of exploring
out and discovering valuable resources that are
dozens of links away from the start set, while carefully pruning the millions
of pages that may lie within this same radius.
Our anecdotes suggest that focused crawling is very effective for building
high-quality collections of Web documents on
specific topics, using modest desktop hardware.}

 ,abstract = {Today's Internet appliances feature user
interface technologies almost unknown a few
years ago: touch screens, styli,
handwriting and voice recognition, speech
synthesis, tiny screens, and more. This
richness creates problems. First. different
appliances use different languages: WML for
cell phones; SpeechML, JSML, and VoxML for
voice enabled devices such as phones; HTML and XUL for desktop computers, and
so on. Thus, developers must maintain multiple
source code families to deploy interfaces to one information system
on multiple appliances. Second, user interfaces
differ dramatically in complexity (e.g, PC versus cell phone
interfaces). Thus, developers must also manage
interface content. Third, developers
risk writing appliance-specific interfaces for
an appliance that might not be on the market
tomorrow. A solution is to build
interfaces with a single, universal language
free of assumptions about appliances and
interface technology. This paper
introduces such a language, the User Interface
Markup Language (UIML), an XML-compliant
language. UIML insulates the interface designer from the peculiarities
of different appliances through style sheets. A
measure of the power of UIML is that it can replace hand-coding of Java AWT
or Swing user interfaces.}

 ,keywords = "persistent connections, connection management, caching"
 ,abstract = {Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic
dominates Internet traffic. The exchange of
HTTP messages is implemented
using the connection-oriented TCP. HTTP/l.0
establishes a new TCP connection for each HTTP
request, resulting in many consecutive short-lived TCP connections.
The emerging HTTP/ 1.1 reduces latencies and
overhead from closing and re-establishing connections by supporting
persistent connections as a default. A TCP
connection which is kept open and reused for the next HTTP request reduces
overhead and latency. Open connections,
however, consume sockets and memory
for socket-buffers. This trade-off establishes
a need for connection-management policies. We
propose policies that exploit embedded information in the HTTP request
messages, e.g., senders' identities and
requested URLs. and compare them to the fixed-timeout policy used in the current
implementation of the Apache Web server. An
experimental evaluation of connection management policies at Web
servers, conducted using Web server logs. shows
that our URL-based policy consistently outperforms other policies. and
achieves significant 15-25% reduction in cost
with respect to the fixed-timeout
policy. Hence, allowing Web servers and clients
to more fully reap the benefits of persistent HTTP.}

  ,abstract = {We describe our Simple Digital Library Interoperability
               Protocol (SDLIP), which allows clients to query
               information sources in a uniform syntax.  The protocol
               was developed in a collaboration between Stanford, the
               Universities of California at Berkeley, and Santa
               Barbara, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, and the
               California Digital Library. In addition to introducing
               the protocol, we describe several of our design
               choices, and compare them with the choices made in
               other search middleware approaches. The protocol allows
               for both stateful and stateless operation, supports
               multiple query languages, and defines a simple
               XML-based return format. A default query language that
               is included in SDLIP follows the evolving IETF DASL
               'basicsearch'. This is an XML-encoded language
               reminiscent of SQL, but adjusted for use in full-text
               environments. SDLIP can be used with CORBA or HTTP. }

  abstract = { We identify crucial design issues in building a distributed
                inverted index for a large collection of web pages. We introduce
                a novel pipelining technique for structuring the core index-
building
                system that substantially reduces the index construction time.
We also
                propose a storage scheme for creating and managing inverted
files
                using an embedded database system. We propose and compare
different
                strategies for addressing various issues relevant to distributed
index
                construction. Finally, we present performance results from
experiments
                on a testbed distributed indexing system that we have
implemented.}

               and are difficult to operate. Instead of running
               crawlers at many client sites, we propose a central
               crawler and Web repository that then multicasts
               appropriate subsets of the central repository to
               clients. Loads at Web servers are reduced because a
               single crawler visits the servers, as opposed to all
               the client crawlers. In this paper we model and
               evaluate such a central Web multicast facility. We
               develop multicast algorithms for the facility,
               comparing them with ones for "broadcast disks." We also
               evaluate performance as several factors, such as object
               granularity and client batching, are varied.

  the materials and making high resolution 2D images available.  The
  underlying assumption is that the objects are flat.  However,
  older materials may not be flat in practice, being warped and
  crinkled due to decay, neglect, accident and the passing of time.
  In such cases, 2D imaging is insufficient to capture the look

  necessary to create a realistic facsimile.  This paper outlines
  a technique for capturing an accurate 3D representation of library

  important task in a world where thousands of documents are just one
  click away.  Thus, powerful indices are necessary to support effective
  retrieval.  The upcoming XML standard represents an important step in this
  direction as its semistructured representation conveys document
  metadata together with the text of the document.  For example, retrieval
  of scientific papers by authors or affiliations would be a straightforward
  task if papers were stored in XML.  Unfortunately, today, the largest
  majority of documents on the web are available in forms that do not carry
  additional semantics.  Converting existing documents to a semistructured
  representation is time consuming and no automatic process can be easily
  applied.  In this paper we discuss a system, based on a novel spatial/visual
  knowledge principle, for extracting metadata from scientific papers
  stored as PostScript files.  Our system embeds the general knowledge
  about the graphic layout of a scientific paper to guide the metadata
  extraction process.  Our system can effectively assist the automatic

  Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and
  extracting tuples from plain-text documents.  At each iteration of the
  extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns

  reliable ones for the next iteration.  In this paper we also develop a

  in which patrons perform all scholarly work electronically.  A proposal is
  then made for patron-augmented digital libraries (PADLs), a class of
  digital libraries that supports the digital scholarship of its patrons.
  Finally, a prototype PADL (called Synchrony) providing access to video
  segments and associated textual transcripts is described.  Synchrony
  allows patrons to search the library for artifacts, create
  annotations/original compositions, integrate these artifacts to form
  synchronized mixed text and video presentations and, after suitable
  review, publish these presentations into the digital library if desired.
  A study to evaluate the PADL concept and usability of Synchrony is also
  discussed.  The study revealed that participants were able to use
  Synchrony for the authoring and publishing of presentations and that

systems increasing, tools for automatically organizaing and presenting

organization and structuring, hardly any system incorporates automatic
structural analysis and representation.  Yet, genre information
(unconsciously) forms one of the most distinguishing features in
conventional libraries and in information searches.  In this paper we
present an approach to automatically analyze the structure of documents
and to integrate this information into an automatically created content-based
organization. In the resulting visualization, documents on similar topics,
yet representing different genres, are depicted as books in differing colors.
This representation supports users intuitively in locating relevant
information presented in a relvant form.}

In this paper we are interested in a moe general formulation where

digital libraries of scanned books and magazines. We describe a method
for classifying pages of sequential OCR text dosuments into one of several
assigned categories and suggest that taking into account contextual
information provided by the whole page sequence can significantly improve
classification accuracy. The proposed architecture relies on hidden Markov
models whose emissions are bag-of-words according to a multinomial word event
model, as in the generative portion of the Naive Bayes classifier. Our results
on a collection of scanned journals from the Making of America project
contirm the importance of using whole page sequences. Empirical evaluation
indicates that the error rate (as obtained by running a plain Naive Bayes
classifier on isolated page) can be roughly reduced by hald if contextual
information is incorporated.}

definition and use of "linked active content", which builds on the
hypertext paradigm by extending it to support active content. This
concept has community development advantages, since it provides an
authoring paradigm that supports contributions from a more diverse
audience, including especially those who have substantial classroom
and pedagogical expertise but lack programming expertise. It also
promotes the extraction of content from software so that collections
may be better organized and more easily repurposed to meet the needs
of a diverse audience of educations and students.}

previous evaluations of Kea that rely on author keywords. Second, they show
Kea's performance is comparable to that of similar systems that have been

policy for the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). A
distinctive feature of DLESE as a digital library is the 'DLESE community,'
composed of voluntary members who contribute metadata and resource reviews
to DLESE. As the DLESE community is open, the question of how to evaluate
community contributions is  a crucial part of the review policy design
process. In this paper, technological frames theory is used to analyse this
design process by looking at how the designers work with two differing
definitions of the 'peer reviewer,' (a) per reviewer as arbiter or editor,
and (b) peer reviewer as colleague. Content analysis of DLESE documents
shows that these frames can in turn be related to two definitions that DLESE
offers of itself: DLESE as a library, and DLESE as a digital artifact. The
implications of the presence of divergent, technological frames for the
design process are summarised, and some suggestions for future research
are outlined.}

task of their own choosing to retrieve documents from publicly available
digital libraries. Various classes of usability difficulties were found.
Here, we focus on use in context -- that is, usability concerns that arise
from the fact that libraries are accessed in particular ways, under
technically and organisationally imposed constraints, and that use of
any particular resource is discretionary. The concepts from an Interaction
Framework, which provides support for reasoning about patterns of
interaction between users and systems, are applied to understand interaction
issues.}

planned digital library for human movement, i.e. on the aspect of representation
and recognition of human activity from video data. The method of representation
is important since it has a major impact on the design of all the other building
blocks of our system such as the user interface/query block or the activity
recognition/storage block. In this paper we evaluate a representation method
for human movement that is based on sequences of angular poses and angular
velocites of the human skeletal joints, for storage and retrieval of human
actions in video databases. The choice of a representation method plays an
important role in the database structure, search methods, storage efficiency
etc.. For this representation, we develop a novel approach for complex human
activity recognition by employing multidimensional indexing combined with
temporal or sequential correlation. this scheme is then evaluated with respect
to its efficiency in storage and retrieval.
For the indexing we use postures of humans in videos that are decomposed into
a set of multidimensional tuples which represent the poses/velocities of human
body parts such as arms, legs and torso. Three novel methods for human activity
recognition are theoretically and experimentally compared. The methods require
only a few sparsely sampled human postures. We also achieve speed invariant
recognition of activities by eliminating the time factor and replacing it with
sequence information. The indexing approach also provides robust recognition
and an efficient storage/retrieval of all the activities in a small set of hash
tables.}

that address the distinction between designing digital libraries for

Design is a key element of any successful product. Good designers and their
designs put technology into the hands of the user, making the produc'ts focus
comprehensible and tangible through design. As straightforward as this may
appear,
the design of learning technologies is often masked by the enabling technology.
In fact, they often lack an explicitly stated instructional design methodology.
While the technologies are important hurdles to overcome, we advocate learning
systems that empower education-driven experiences rather than technology-driven
experiences. This work describes a concept for a digital library for science,
mathematics, engineering and technology education (SMETE), a library with an
information architecture designed to meet learners' and educators' needs.
Utilizing a constructivist model of learning, the authors present practical
approaches to implementing the information architecture and it technology
underpinnings. The authors propose the specifications for the information
architecture and a visual design of a digital library for communicating learning
to the audience. The design methodology indicates that a scenario-driven design
technique sensitive to the contextual nature of learning offers a useful
framework
for tailoring technologies that help empower, not hinder, the educational
sector.}

declarative description of how a data object should behave is attached to the
object, either by a user or by a data input device. A widespread infrastructure
of self-administering data handlers is presumed to exist; these handlers are
responsible for carrying out the specifications attached to the data. Typically,
the specifications express how and to whom the data should be transferred, how
it should be incorporated when it is received, what rights recipients of the
data
will have with respect toit, and the kind of relation that should exist between
distributed copies of the object. Functions such as distributed version control
can be implemented on top of the basic handler functions.
We suggest that this model can provide superior support for common cooperative
functions. Because the model is declarative, users need only express their
intentions once in creating a self-administering description, and need not be
concerned with manually performing subsequent repetitious operations. Because
the model is peer-to-per, users are less dependent on additional, perhaps costly
resources, at least when these are not critical.
An initial implementation of the model has been created. We are experimenting
with the model both as a tool to aid in digital library functions, and as a
possible replacement for some server oriented functions.}

variety of challenges from technical to social and organization. The technical
challenge is to ensure that the information, generated today, can survive long
term changes in storage media, devices and data formats. This paper presents a
novel approach to the problem. It distinguishes between archiving of data files
and archiving of programs (so that their behavior may be reenacted in the
future).
For the archiving of a data file, the proposal consists of specifying the
processing that needs to be performed on the data (as physically stored) in
order to return the information to a future client (according to a logical
view of the data). The process specification and the logical view definition
are archived with the data.
For the archiving of a program behavior, the proposal consists of saving the
original executable object code together with the specificaiton of the
processing
that needs to be performed for each machine instruction of the original computer
(emulation).
In both cases, the processing specificatio is based on a Universal Virtual
Computer that is general, yet basic enough as to remain relevant in the future.}

Hermes offers sophisticated filtering capabilities preventing the user

makes it easy for publishers to join the service and thus reaching the

that resource reuse occurs at different stages in the educational design
process, and each stage imposes different and possibly conflicting

a distributed process across several artifacts, both within and outside

to rank text segments, producing summaries that contain a user-defined number of
sentences.  We hypothesize that ranking text segments via traditional
sentence-selection heuristics produces a balanced summary with more useful
information than one produced by using segmentation alone.  The proposed summary
is created in a three-step process, which includes 1) sentence evaluation 2)
segment
identification and 3) segment ranking.  As the required length of the summary
changes,
low-ranking segments can then be dropped from (or higher ranking segments added
to)
the summary.   We compare the output of TXTRACTOR to the output of a
segmentation
tool based on the TextTiling algorithm to validate the approach.}

systems aim to improve search performance by providing users with specific

Our goal is to answer factual questions by exploiting the structure inherent in
documents found on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Based on this structure, documents
are indexed into smaller units and associated with metadata. Transforming table
cells into smaller units associated with metadata is an important part of this
task. In addition, we report on work to improve question classification using
language models.  The domain used to develop this system is documents retrieved
from a crawl of www.fedstats.gov.}

facet

ontology in RDF and RDF schemas of semantic web and a thesaurus, we implement
methods to allow easily annotating images into RDF instances and parsing
natural language like queries into the query schema in XML format. We also
implement a partial structural matching algorithm to match the query schema
with images at the level of semantic schemas. Therefore the historical images
can be retrieved by native users of domain specific history in terms of natural
language like queries.}

of the services provided by traditional libraries but to extend them.  Basic
finding aids such as search and browse are common in most of today's digital

and browseable shelves of books, an effective digital library should offer a
wider range of services.  Using the traditional library concept of special
collections as a model, in this paper we propose that explicitly defining
sub-collections in the digital library-virtual collections-can benefit both
the library's users and contributors and increase its viability.  We first
introduce the concept of a virtual collection, outline the costs and benefits
for defining such collections, and describe an implementation of collection-
level
metadata to create virtual collections for two different digital libraries.  We
conclude by discussing the implications of virtual collections for enhancing
interoperability and sharing across digital libraries, such as those that are
part of the National SMETE Digital Library.}

information systems, due in part to their intrinsic multi-disciplinary nature.
Nowadays DLs are built within monolithic, tightly integrated, and generally
inflexible systems -- or by assembling disparate components together in an
ad-hoc way, with resulting problems in interoperability and adaptability.
More importantly, conceptual modeling, requirements analysis, and software
engineering approaches are rarely supported, making it extremely difficult to
tailor DL content and behavior to the interests, needs, and preferences of
particular communities. In this paper, we address these problems. In particular,
we present 5SL, a declarative language for specifying and generating domain-
specific
digital libraries. 5SL is based on the 5S formal theory for digital libraries
and
enables high-level specification of DLs in five complementary dimensions,
including: the kinds of multimedia information the DL supports (Stream Model);
how that information is structured and organized (Structural Model); different
logical and presentational properties and operations of DL components
(Spatial Model); the behavior of the DL (Scenario Model); and the different
societies of actors and managers of services that act together to carry out
the DL behavior (Societal Model). The practical feasibility of the approach is
demonstrated by the presentation of a 5SL digital library generator for the
MARIAN digital library system.}

Screen. Envision used a rigid matrix to display search results. As with
various other visualization tools, it provided no overview, thus no context

approaches (e.g., ThemeScapes) are almost exactly opposite, displaying
data in a completely flexible manner. The data is not bound to any axis but
is arranged according to relationships between documents. We now explore a
middle ground with an overview as well as loose matrix arrangement, with

from the page images that comprise each piece in a collection.  It is often the
case, as it is with the Levy Collection, that lyrics embedded in music notation
are written in a syllabicated form so that each syllable lines up with the note
or notes to which it corresponds.   Searching the syllabicated form of words,
however, would be counterintuitive and cumbersome for end-users. This paper
describes a tool that, using a simple algorithm, rebuilds complete words from
lyric syllables and, in ambiguous cases, provides feedback to the collection
builder.

Collection,

subjects.  The manual segmentation result has been processed to detect the
most probable boundaries in the melodic surface, using a probabilistic
decision function.  The detected boundaries have then been compared with the
boundaries detected by an automatic procedure implementing an algorithm for
melody segmentation, as well as by a random segmenter and by a n-gram-based

is
closer to manual segmentation than algorithms that do not use such information.}

In this paper we introduce the concept of Routing Indices (RIs), which allow nodes
to forward queries to neighbors that are more likely to have answers. If a node
cannot answer a query, it forwards the query to a subset of its neighbors, based
on its local RI, rather than by selecting neighbors at random or by flooding the
network by forwarding the query to all neighbors. We present three RI schemes:
the compound, the hop-count, and the exponential routing indices. We evaluate
their performance via simulations, and find that RIs can improve performance
by one or two orders of magnitude vs. a flooding-based system, and by up to
100% vs. a random forwarding system. We also discuss the tradeoffs between
the different RI schemes and highlight the effects of key design variables

An efficient solution is IP-multicast, but it suffers from poor deployment.
Application-level multicast is being increasingly recognized as a viable
alternative. In this work, we discuss and evaluate a tree-based overlay network
called {\em PeerCast} that uses clients to forward the stream to their peers.
PeerCast is designed as a live-media streaming solution for peer-to-peer systems
that are populated by hundreds of autonomous, short-lived nodes. Further, we
argue for the need to take end-host behavior into account while evaluating an
application-level multicast architecture. An end-host behavior model is
proposed that allows us to capture a range of realistic peer behavior. Using
this model, we develop robust, yet simple, tree-maintenance policies. Through
empirical runs and extensive simulations, we show that PeerCast provides good
QoS, which gracefully degrades with the number of clients. We have implemented
a PeerCast prototype, which is available for download.}

Super-peer networks strike a balance between the inherent efficiency of centralized

distributed search. Furthermore, they take advantage of the heterogeneity of
capabilities (e.g., bandwidth, processing power) across peers, which recent
studies have shown to be enormous. Hence, new and old P2P systems like
Morpheus and Gnutella are adopting super-peers in their design. Despite
their growing popularity, the behavior of super-peer networks is not well

networks? How can super-peers be made more reliable? How many clients should
a super-peer take on to maximize efficiency? In this paper we examine

developed based on anecdotal evidence of user needs, intuitive

assumptions of typical usage scenarios. Emphasis has instead been
placed on basic research into music document representation,
efficient searching, and audio-based searching, rather than on
exploring the music information needs or information behavior of
a target user group. This paper focuses on eliciting the 'native'
music information strategies employed by people searching for
popular music (that is, music sought for recreational or enjoyment
purposes rather than to support a 'serious' or scientific exploration
of some aspect of music). To this end, we conducted an ethnographic
study of the searching/browsing techniques employed by people in the
researchers' local communities, as they use two common sources of music:
the public library and music stores. We argue that the insights provided
by this type of study can inform the development of searching/browsing
support for music digital libraries.}

 ,abstract = {Score-based music information retrieval (MIR) systems search databases
of musical scores to find occurrences of a musical query pattern. Several
such systems have been developed based on exhaustive approximate search of
the database. Exhaustive search does not scale well, however, to large
databases. This paper describes a method of automatically creating a
content-based index of musical scores. The goal is to capture the themes,
or motifs, that appear in the music. User queries, then, would be matched
only over the index, rather than over the entire database. The method was
tested by building an index of 25 orchestral movements from the classical
music literature. For every movement, the system captured the primary theme,
or a variation of the primary theme. In addition, it captured 13 of 28
secondary themes. The resulting index was 14% of the size of the database.
By deleting musical patterns not found early in the music, it is possible to
reduce the size of the index to 2% of the database; however, this method
discards secondary themes. A listening experiment using five symphonic
movements showed that people can reliably recognize secondary themes after
listening to a piece of music therefore, it may be necessary to retain secondary
themes in a score index.}

summarizes this repetition information and infers the structure based on
heuristic rules. The performance of the approach is demonstrated visually
using figures for qualitative evaluation, and by two structural similarity
measures for quantitative evaluation. Based on the structural analysis result,
this paper also proposes a method for music thumbnailing. The preliminary

experiments using bibliographic references obtained from scanned images

values are extracted from OCR processed references with the accuracy
of 93.9%. We also show that the proposed model has advantages in

language query into a resource description framework (RDF) format, a
semantic-web standard of metadata description that supports machine readable
semantic representation. This same parser is also extended to perform the
semantic annotation on the descriptive metadata of images and convert
metadata automatically into the same RDF representation. The retrieval of
images can then be conducted by matching the semantic and structural
descriptions of the user query with those of the annotated descriptive
metadata of images. We tested our problem domain by retrieving the historical

We have constructed and implemented the domain ontology, a Mandarin Chinese

emerging as a center of innovation in digital libraries as applied to education. As a part of this
extensive project, the GetSmart system was created to apply knowledge management techniques
in a learning environment. The design of the system is based on an analysis of learning theory
and the information search process. Its key notion is the integration of search tools and curriculum
support with concept mapping. More than 100 students at the University of Arizona and
Virginia Polytechnic Institute used the system in the fall of 2002. A database of more than
one thousand student-prepared concept maps has been collected with more than forty
thousand relationships expressed in semantic, graphical, node-link representations.
Preliminary analysis of the collected data is revealing interesting knowledge representation patterns.}

 ,abstract = {The increasing power of techniques to model complex geometry and extract meaning
from 3D information create complex data that must be described, stored, and displayed to be useful
to researchers. Responding to the limitations of two-dimensional (2D) data representations perceived
by discipline scientists, the Partnership for Research in Spatial Modeling (PRISM) project at Arizona
State University (ASU) developed modeling and analytic tools that raise the level of abstraction and
add semantic value to 3D data. The goals are to improve scientific communication, and to assist in
generating new knowledge, particularly for natural objects whose asymmetry limit study using 2D
representations. The tools simplify analysis of surface and volume using curvature and topology to
help researchers understand and interact with 3D data. The tools produced automatically extract
information about features and regions of interest to researchers, calculate quantifiable, replicable
metric data, and generate metadata about the object being studied. To help researchers interact
with the information, the project developed prototype interactive, sketch-based interfaces that permit
researchers to remotely search, identify and interact with the detailed, highly accurate 3D models of the
objects. The results support comparative analysis of contextual and spatial information, and extend
research about asymmetric man-made and natural objects.}

 ,abstract = {The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
began as an alternative to distributed searching of scholarly eprint repositories. The model
embraced by the OAI-PMH is that of metadata harvesting, where value-added services
(by a ``service provider'') are constructed on cached copies of the metadata extracted from
the repositories of the harvester's choosing. While this model dispenses with the well known
problems of distributed searching, it introduces the problem of synchronization. Stated simply,
this problem arises when the service provider's copy of the metadata does not match the
metadata currently at the constituent repositories. We define some metrics for describing the
synchronization problem in the OAI-PMH. Based on these metrics, we study the synchronization
problem of the OAI-PMH framework and propose several approaches for harvesters to implement
better synchronization. In particular, if a repository knows its update frequency, it can publish it
in an OAI-PMH Identify response using an optional About container that borrows from RDF Site
Syndication (RSS) Format.}

there is a crucial need for more effective user interfaces to access these materials. To support

stand in for the videos in the collection, analogous to abstracts standing in for documents). The
current study investigated four variations (i.e., speeds) of one form of video surrogate: a fast forward
of the video created by selecting every Nth frame from the full video. In addition, it provided a field
test of the validity of six measures of user performance when interacting with video surrogates.
Forty-five study participants interacted with all four versions of the fast forward surrogate, and
completed all six performance tasks with each surrogate. Surrogate speed affected performance
on four measures: object recognition (graphical), action recognition, linguistic gist comprehension
(full text), and visual gist comprehension. Based on these results, we recommend that the default
speed for fast forward surrogates should be about 1:64 of the original video keyframes. In addition,
users should control the choice of fast forward speed to adjust for content characteristics and
personal preferences.}

Web-DL, that allows the construction of digital libraries from the Web. The Web-DL environment will allow us
to collect data from the Web, standardize it and publish it through a digital library system. It provides support
to services and organizational structure normally available in digital libraries, but benefiting from the breadth
of the Web contents. We experimented with applying the Web-DL environment to the Networked Digital Library of
Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), thus demonstrating that the rapid construction of DLs from the Web is possible.
Also, Web-DL provides an alternative as a large-scale solution for interoperability between independent digital libraries.}

volunteer contributors. This study analyzes the emergence of hyperlinked structures within the
ibiblio collection. In the context of ibiblio, we analyze the suitability of Barabasi's model
of preferential attachment to describe the distribution of incoming links. We find that the
degree of maintainer activity for a given site (as measured by the voluntary development of
descriptive metadata) is a stronger link count predictor for ibiblio than is a site's age,
as the standard model predicts. Thus we argue that the efforts of ibiblio's contributors
positively affect the popularity of their materials.}

common words that are derived from earlier manuscript practice. While these abbreviations are
usually easily deciphered by a reader well-versed in Latin, they pose technical problems
for full text digitization: they are difficult to OCR or have typed and - if they are not
expanded correctly - they limit the effectiveness of information retrieval and reading
support tools in the digital library. In this paper, I will describe a method for the
automatic expansion and disambiguation of these abbreviations.}

  ,abstract = {We attach an inexpensive pressure sensor to the side of a PDA and use
               it as three input devices at once. Users can squeeze the
               device to provide near-continuous input to applications. At
               the same time the drivers interpret a sudden full squeeze as
               the push of a virtual button. A user's sudden pressure
               release while squeezing is detected as the push of a second
               virtual button. We briefly describe our hardware and signal
               processing techniques. The remainder of the writing
               describes an experiment that explores whether users can cope
           cognitively with the 3-in-1 control. We compare against a
           three-control setup consisting of a jog wheel and two physical
           buttons. We show that the 3-in-1 control enables a 13% faster reaction
           time over the three-control, but that the 3-in-1 suffers a 4% penalty
           in the accuracy of users choosing between the two buttons in response
           to cues from an application. We show that a good choice of application
           cue is more important for assuring accuracy in the 3-in-1 than in the
           more traditional set of separate controls. In particular, we
               examined four types of cues. One abstract cue, one cue with
               clear semantic relevance to the application, one symbolic,
               and one textual cue.

digital libraries, focusing on the strengths, limitations and scope of
each approach. Two of the techniques, Heuristic Evaluation and
Cognitive Walkthrough, were applied in text-book fashion, because there
was no obvious way to contextualize them to the Digital Libraries (DL)

set of re-usable scenarios and personas that relate the approach
specifically to DL development. The fourth technique, CASSM, relates
explicitly to the DL domain by combining empirical data with an
analytical approach. We have found that Heuristic Evaluation and
Cognitive Walkthrough only address superficial aspects of interface
design (but are good for that), whereas Claims Analysis and CASSM can
help identify deeper conceptual difficulties (but demand greater skill
of the analyst). However, none fit seamlessly within the fragmented

Environment (DLE) services are being developed and evaluated
iteratively over the course of this research project. In the 2002-2003
academic year, the DLE was implemented in stages during the fall and
spring terms in undergraduate geography courses at the University of
California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Evaluation of the fall term
implementation identified design issues of time and complexity of use
in the services for creating and organizing course domain knowledge. By
the time of the spring term implementation, these issues were addressed
and new services added for integrating selected course content into a
variety of class presentation formats. The implementation was evaluated
via interviews with the course instructor, development staff, and
students, and by observations (in person and videotaped) of the course.
Results of the iterative evaluation indicated that usability and
functionality for the instructor had increased between the two course
offerings. Students found classroom presentations to be useful for
understanding concepts, and Web access to the presentations useful for
study and review. Assessments of student learning suggest modest
improvements over time. Developers are now applying lessons learned
during these implementations to improve the system for subsequent

representation of a trail is a GPS track log, recorded as recreators
travel on trails. As users complete trips, the GPS tracklogs of their

is that track logs will overlap and intersect each other. We present a
method for the combination of overlapping and intersecting GPS track
logs into a network of GPS trails. Each trail segment in the network
can then be attributed by automatic and manual means, producing a
digital library of trails. We also describe the TopoFusion system which

unstructured queries to the use of structured queries. We then tested
the capability of a simple Bayesian network system, built on top of a
DL retrieval engine, to infer the best structured queries from the
keywords entered by the user. Experiments performed with 20 users
working with a DL containing a large collection of computer science
literature clearly indicate that structured queries, either manually

three-dimensional graphics to preserve context even while the user

interface, a user can either get an overview for context or else see a
single selected item, sacrificing the context view. In our 3D Vase
Museum, the user can navigate seamlessly from a high level
scatterplot-like plan view to a perspective overview of a subset of the
collection, to a view of an individual item, to retrieval of data
associated with that item, all within the same virtual room and without
any mode change or special command. We present this as an example of a
solution to the problem of focus-plus-context in information
visualization. We developed 3D models from the 2D photographs in the
collection and placed them in our 3D virtual room. We evaluated our
approach by comparing it to the conventional interface in Perseus using

 ,abstract = {A large amount of research, technical and
professional documents are available today in digital formats. Digital
libraries are created to facilitate search and retrieval of information
supplied by the documents. These libraries may span an entire area of
interest (e.g., computer science) or be limited to documents within a
small organization. While tools that index, classify, rank and retrieve
documents from such libraries are important, it would be worthwhile to
complement these tools with information available on the Web. We
propose one such technique that uses a topical crawler driven by the
information extracted from a research document. The goal of the crawler
is to harvest a collection of Web pages that are focused on the topical
subspaces associated with the given document. The collection created
through Web crawling is further processed using lexical and linkage
analysis. The entire process is automated and uses machine learning
techniques to both guide the crawler as well as analyze the collection
it fetches. A report is generated at the end that provides visual cues
and information to the researcher. }

Specifically, this framework includes: (a) A novel multimodal context

(c) A cost-sensitive semantic video classification framework to address

 ,abstract = {Automatic generation of semantic metadata
describing spatial relations is highly desirable for image digital

convey important information about the image. Because the perception of
spatial relations is subjective, we propose a novel framework for
automatic metadata generation based on fuzzy k-nn classification that
generates fuzzy semantic metadata describing spatial relations between
objects in an image. For each pair of objects of interest, the
corresponding R-histogram is computed and used as input for a set of
fuzzy k-nn classifiers. The R-histogram is a quantitative
representation of spatial relations between two objects. The outputs of
the classifiers are soft class labels for each of the following eight
spatial relations: 1) Left of, 2) Right of, 3) Above, 4) Below, 5)
Near, 6) Far, 7) Inside, 8) Outside. Because the classifier-training
stage involves annotating the training images manually, it is desirable
to use as few training images as possible. To address this issue, we
applied existing prototype selection techniques and also devised two
new extensions. We evaluated the performance of different fuzzy k-nn
algorithms and prototype selection algorithms empirically on both
synthetic and real images. Preliminary experimental results show that
our system is able to obtain good annotation accuracy (92%-98% on

encountered material. Furthermore, the function of these clippings
extends far beyond a simple exchange of content to inform the
recipient; in fact, the content itself may have little immediate value
to the recipient. We also found the practice to be ubiquitous: all of
our participants had both shared clippings with others and received

advantage of this approach is that users can query any topic and
learn about relevant real-world entities without dedicated databases for the topic.
In particular, we focus on an application for finding
authoritative people from the web. This application is practically
important because once personal names are obtained, they can
lead users from the web to managed information stored in digital libraries.
To explore effective ways of finding
people, we first examine the distribution of Japanese personal names by
analyzing about 50 million Japanese web pages. We observe that personal
names appear frequently on the web, but the distribution is
highly influenced by automatically generated texts. To remedy the
bias and find widely acknowledged people accurately, we utilize
the number of servers containing a name instead of the number of web pages.
We show its effectiveness by

two examples and discuss possible applications. }

 ,abstract = {This research aims to utilize semantic web[1]
technology to the semantic annotation of classical Chinese poetry. We
investigate the feasibilities and advantages of semantic retrieval and
automatic ontology acquisition from semantically annotated poems based
on a Chinese thesaurus. We have induced a set of semantic composition
rules for pair-wise character (word) patterns that can be used to parse
the poem sentences and recursively generate RDF[2] triple relations
among the pair of characters (words). We have also defined a scoring
scheme to assess semantic similarity for semantic retrieval. We showed
that the semantic retrieval method significantly outperformed the
keyword-based retrieval method. }

access to web pages, commercial search portals, such as Google, Yahoo,
AltaVista, and AOL, still lack the ability to answer questions
expressed in a natural language. We explore the feasibility of a
completely trainable approach to the automated question answering on
the Web or large scale digital libraries. By using the inherent
redundancy of large scale collections, each candidate answer found by
the system is triangulated (confirmed or disconfirmed) against other
possible answers. Since our approach is entirely self-learning and does
not involve any linguistic resources it can be easily implemented
within digital libraries or Web search portals. }

 ,abstract = {Today people typically read and annotate printed
documents even if they are obtained from electronic sources like
digital libraries. If there is a reason for them to share these
personal annotations online, they must re-enter them. Given the advent
of better computer support for reading and annotation, including tablet
interfaces, will people ever share their personal digital ink
annotations as is, or will they make substantial changes to them? What
can we do to anticipate and support the transition from personal to
public annotations? To investigate these questions, we performed a
study to characterize and compare students' personal annotations as
they read assigned papers with those they shared with each other using
an online system. By analyzing over 1,700 annotations, we confirmed
three hypotheses: (1) only a small fraction of annotations made while
reading are directly related to those shared in discussion; (2) some
types of annotations  those that consist of anchors in the text
coupled with margin notes  are more apt to be the basis of public
commentary than other types of annotations; and (3) personal
annotations undergo dramatic changes when they are shared in
discussion, both in content and in how they are anchored to the source
document. We then use these findings to explore ways to support the
transition from personal to public annotations. }

 ,abstract = {Creating, maintaining, or using a digital library
requires the manipulation of digital documents. Information workspaces
provide a visual representation allowing users to collect, organize,
annotate, and author information. The Visual Knowledge Builder (VKB)
helps users access, collect, annotate, and combine materials from
digital libraries and other sources into a personal information
workspace. VKB has been enhanced to include direct search interfaces
for NSDL and Google. Users create a visualization of search results
while selecting and organizing materials for their current activity.
Additionally, metadata applicators have been added to VKB. This
interface allows the rapid addition of metadata to documents and aids
the user in the extraction of existing metadata for application to
other documents. A study was performed to compare the selection and
organization of documents in VKB to the commonly used tools of a Web
browser and a word processor. This study shows the value of visual
workspaces for such effort but points to the need for sub-document
level objects, ephemeral visualizations, and support for moving from
visual representations to metadata. }

 abstract = {We present a new approach for modeling multi-modal data sets,
 focusing on the specific case of segmented images with associated text.
 Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications.
 We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images
 (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region
 naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections
 of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of
 translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one
 language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and
 semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data
 mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining
 techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the
 joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which
 explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study
 multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical
 clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical
 machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture
 of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a
 large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the
 difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we
 look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative
 measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance
 of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether
 a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation
 performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled
 data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an
 annotation proxy, and manually labeled data.},

Image features (visual and/or semantic) are used to display retrievals as thumbnails in a 2-D spatial layout or configuration which conveys all pair-wise mutual similarities. A graphical optimization technique is used to provide maximally uncluttered and informative layouts. Moreover, a novel subspace feature weighting technique can be used to modify 2-D layouts in a variety of context-dependent ways. An efficient computational technique for subspace weighting and re-estimation leads to a simple user-modeling framework whereby the system can learn to display query results based on layout examples (or relevance feedback) provided by the user. The resulting retrieval, browsing and visualization can adapt to the user's (time-varying) notions of content, context and preferences in style and interactive navigation. Monte Carlo simulations with machine-generated layouts as well as pilot user studies have demonstrated the ability of this framework to model or mimic users, by automatically generating layouts according to their preferences.},

 comment = { Although modern photography has come a long way, the
 process of making and using photographs still requires more
 effort than it should. Using software agents rather than human
 labor can help reduce some of this tedium.Aria is an interface
 agent designed to assist users by proactively looking for
 opportunities for image annotation and retrieval. Although it
 doesn't completely automate image annotation and retrieval, Aria
 dramatically reduces user interface overhead, which can lead to
 better-annotated image libraries and fewer missed opportunities
 for image use.The authors designed Aria's interface agent to
 facilitate--rather than fully automate--the textual annotation
 and retrieval process. The agent's role lies not so much in
 automatically performing the annotation and retrieval but in
 detecting opportunities for performing these functions and
 alerting the user to those opportunities. The agent can also,
 when appropriate, help the user complete the operations.Future
 work will center on taking advantage of more opportunities to use
 context to determine appropriate situations for image annotation,
 image library browsing, and retrieval. The authors are often
 asked how their approach will scale to large image collections.
 Keywords could relate to ontologies and knowledge bases to do
 inheritance or simple inference searches. Aria's retrieval
 technology treats image sets as an unstructured database, but
 perhaps a better method would be to look at sets of pictures as
 linked networks. In the long run, the authors seek to capture and
 use commonsense knowledge about typical picture- taking
 situations.},

	       coguration of off-screen piles. The system allows multiple
	       PDA owners within ad hoc radio range to share off-screen
	       piles. They point out to each other where a shared pile is to
	       reside in space. Once established, all sharing partners may
	       add to the pile and see its contents. One application is to
	       support biodiversity researchers in theeld, where they generate
	       data on their PDA and need to keep it organized until
	       they return to theireld station. We conducted an experiment

               collaborative work in many domains. One application enabled
	       by this new technology is co-present, collaborative search
	       for digital content. For example, a group of students
	       could sit around an interactive table and search for

	       TeamSearch, an application that enables this type of
	       activity by supporting group specification of
	       Boolean-style queries. We explore whether TeamSearch
	       should consider all group members activities as
	       contributing to a single query or should interpret them as
	       separate, parallel search requests. The results reveal
	       that both strategies are similarly efficient, but that
	       collective query formation has advantages in terms of
	       enhancing group collaboration and awareness, allowing
	       users to bootstrap query-specification skills, and
	       personal preference. This suggests that team-centric UIs

               visual interfaces and three control modalities. The three
               interfaces were a traditional thumbnail layout, a layout
               that placed a single picture on the screen at a time, and a
               hybrid that placed one large photo in the center of the
               display, while also displaying a row of neighboring
               thumbnails at the top and bottom of the screen. In a user
               experiment we paired each of these interfaces with each of
               the following three scroll control modalities: a jog dial, a
               squeeze sensor, and an on-screen control that was activated
               by tapping with a stylus. We offer a simple model that
               classifies our experiment's interfaces by how much they
               provide visual context within the photo collection. The
               model also classifies the scroll modalities by how tightly
               they correlate scroll input actions to effects on the
               screen. Performance and attitudinal results from the user
               experiment are presented and discussed.}

	     perception of depth in the palmtop virtual reality condition
	     is about as good as corresponding depth perception in a large

             community is a set of web pages created by
             individuals or associations with a common interest
             on a topic. So far, various link analysis techniques
             have been developed to extract web communities. We
             analyze evolution of web communities by comparing
             four Japanese web archives crawled from 1999 to
             2002. Statistics of these archives and community
             evolution are examined, and the global behavior of
             evolution is described. Several metrics are
             introduced to measure the degree of web community
             evolution, such as growth rate, novelty, and
             stability. We developed a system for extracting
             detailed evolution of communities using these
             metrics. It allows us to understand when and how
             communities emerged and evolved. Some evolution

             link analysis algorithms treat a web page as a
             single node in the web graph. However, in most
             cases, a web page contains multiple semantics and
             hence the web page might not be considered as the
             atomic node. In this paper, the web page is
             partitioned into blocks using the vision-based page
             segmentation algorithm. By extracting the
             page-to-block, block-to-page relationships from link
             structure and page layout analysis, we can construct
             a semantic graph over the WWW such that each node
             exactly represents a single semantic topic. This
             graph can better describe the semantic structure of
             the web. Based on block-level link analysis, we
             proposed two new algorithms, Block Level PageRank

 abstract = {The rapid growth of the web has been noted and tracked
             extensively. Recent studies have however documented
             the dual phenomenon: web pages have small half
             lives, and thus the web exhibits rapid death as
             well. Consequently, page creators are faced with an
             increasingly burdensome task of keeping links
             up-to-date, and many are falling behind. In addition
             to just individual pages, collections of pages or
             even entire neighborhoods of the web exhibit
             significant decay, rendering them less effective as
             information resources. Such neighborhoods are
             identified only by frustrated searchers, seeking a
             way out of these stale neighborhoods, back to more
             up-to-date sections of the web; measuring the decay
             of a page purely on the basis of dead links on the
             page is too naive to reflect this frustration. In
             this paper we formalize a strong notion of a decay
             measure and present algorithms for computing it
             efficiently. We explore this measure by presenting a
             number of validations, and use it to identify
             interesting artifacts on today's web. We then
             describe a number of applications of such a measure
             to search engines, web page maintainers,

             but much of this information is fluid; it changes,
             moves, and occasionally disappears. Bookmarks, paths

             examples of page collections that can become
             out-of-date as changes are made to their
             components. Maintaining these collections requires
             that they be updated continuously. Tools to help in
             this maintenance require an understanding of what
             changes are important, such as when pages no longer

Key objectives of these initiatives are to improve teacher and learner access to high-quality learning resources and to increase their use in order to improve education. In this article, we take a broader view by proposing a framework that incorporates inputs and process variables affecting these desired outcomes. Inputs include variables such as audience characteristics. Outcomes include increased teacher and student use of learning resources from digital libraries. In particular, two key variables are examined in this framework. The first is a professional development program aimed at educators on the topic of using educational digital libraries. The second is a simple end-user authoring service, called the Instructional Architect (IA). The IA helps users, particularly teachers, discover, select, sequence, annotate, and reuse learning resources stored in digital libraries.}

We demonstrate its flexibility by showing how digital library collections can be extended and altered to satisfy new requirements.}

The study shows that satisfaction is greater and performance is significantly better on specific and generic information retrieval tasks from news broadcasts when transcripts are available for search.

We study how to identify known item queries in the context of a large academic institutions online public access catalog (OPAC). We also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved the item in question. Our approach combines techniques in machine learning, language modeling and machine translation evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable of distinguishing known item queries with an accuracy of 72% and correctly classifies titles for whether they are the known item sought with an accuracy of 86%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such work, which has the potential to streamline the user interface of both OPACs and digital libraries in support of known item searches.}

 ,abstract = {An ever-increasing amount of information on the Web today is available only through search interfaces: the users have to type in a set of keywords in a search form in order to access the pages from certain Web sites. These pages are often referred to as the Hidden Web or the Deep Web. Since there are no static links to the Hidden Web pages, search engines cannot discover and index such pages and thus do not return them in the results. However, according to recent studies, the content provided by many Hidden Web sites is often of very high quality and can be extremely valuable to many users. In this paper, we study how we can build an effective Hidden Web crawler that can autonomously discover and download pages from the Hidden Web. Since the only ``entry point'' to a Hidden Web site is a query interface, the main challenge that a Hidden Web crawler has to face is how to automatically generate meaningful queries to issue to the site. Here, we provide a theoretical framework to investigate the query generation problem for the Hidden Web and we propose effective policies for generating queries automatically. Our policies proceed iteratively, issuing a different query in every iteration. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of these policies on 4 real Hidden Web sites and our results are very promising. For instance, in one experiment, one of our policies downloaded more than 90% of a Hidden Web site (that contains 14 million documents) after issuing fewer than 100 queries.}

 ,abstract = {

    Users of modern digital libraries (DLs) can keep themselves up-to-date by searching and browsing their favorite collections, or more conveniently by resorting to an alerting service. The alerting service notifies its clients about new or changed documents. So far, no sophisticated service has been proposed that covers heterogeneous and distributed collections and is integrated with the digital library software.

    This paper analyses the conceptual requirements of this much-sought after service for digital libraries. We demonstrate that the diffing concepts of digital libraries and its underlying technical design has extensive influence (a) the expectations, needs and interests of users regarding an alerting service, and (b) on the technical possibilities of the implementation of the service.

    Our findings will show that the range of issues surrounding alerting services for digital libraries, their design and use is greater than one may anticipate. We also show that, conversely, the requirements for an alerting service have considerable impact on the concepts of DL design. Our findings should be of interest for librarians as well as system designers. We highlight and discuss the far-reaching implications for the design of, and interaction with, libraries. This paper discusses on the lessons learned from building such a distributed alerting service. We present our prototype implementation as a proof-of-concept for an alerting service for open DL software.}

One of the most successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms that explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend from the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms.}

A challenging aspect is that while topics are often identifiable by keywords alone, sentiment can be expressed in a more subtle manner which means sentiment requires more natural language understanding than the usual topic-based classification. A prototype system has been developed to assist users to quickly focus on recommended (or non-recommended) information by automatically classifying Web search results into four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and non-review documents, by using an automatic classifier based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM).}

By general documents, we mean documents that do not belong to any specific genre, including presentations, book chapters, technical papers, brochures, reports, and letters. Previously, methods were proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It was not clear whether it is possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize format information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of format information is the key to a successful extraction from general documents. Precision and recall for title extraction from Word were 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint were 0.875 and 0.895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language. Moreover, we can significantly improve search ranking results in document retrieval by using the extracted titles.}

No sooner have users needs been identified and supported than they change. This paper evaluates the changing information requirements of users through their information journey in two different domains (health and academia). In-depth analysis of findings from interviews, focus groups and observations of 150 users have identified three stages to this journey: information initiation, facilitation (or gathering) and interpretation. The study shows that, although digital libraries are supporting aspects of users information facilitation, there are still requirements for them to better support users overall information work in context. Users are poorly supported in the initiation phase, as they recognize their information needs, especially with regard to resource awareness; in this context, interactive press-alerts are discussed. Some users (especially clinicians and patients) also required support in the interpretation of information, both satisfying themselves that the information is trustworthy and understanding what it means for a particular individual.}

By modifying the methods and tools used to evaluate traditional libraries content and services, measures can be developed whose results can be used across a variety of DLs. The DigiQUAL protocol being developed by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) has the potential to provide the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) with a standardized methodology and survey instrument with which to evaluate not only its distributed projects but also to gather data to assess the value and impact of the NSDL.}

 ,entered-by = "Rebecca Wesley"
 ,abstract = {This paper examines user choice of interface language in a bi-language digital library (English and M&#257;ori, the language of the indigenous people of New Zealand). The majority of collection documents are in M&#257;ori, and the interface is available in both M&#257;ori and English. Log analysis shows three categories of preference for interface language: primarily English, primarily M&#257;ori, and bilingual (switching back and forth between the two). As digital libraries increase in number, content, and potential user base, interest has grown in multilingual or multi-language collections-that is, digital libraries in which the collection documents and the collection interface include more than one language. Research in multilingual/multi-language digital libraries and web-based document collections has primarily focused on fundamental implementation issues and functionality, principles for design, and small-scale usability tests; at present no analysis exists of how these systems are used, or how the presence of more than one language in a digital library affects user interactions-presumably because multilingual/multi-language digital libraries are only recently moving from research lab prototypes to fielded systems, and few have built up a significant usage history. This paper describes the application of log analysis to examine interface language preference in a bi-language (English/M&#257;ori) digital library-the Niupepa Collection (Section 2). Web log data was collected for a year (Section 3), and log analysis indicates three categories of interface language preferences: English, M&#257;ori, and bilingual (Section 4). A fine-grained analysis of activities within user sessions indicates different patterns of document access and information gathering strategy between these three categories (Section 5).}

    Our system suggests likely identity labels for photographs in a personal photo collection. Instead of using face recognition techniques, the system leverages automatically-available context, like the time and location where the photos were taken.

    Based on time and location, the system automatically computes event and location groupings of photos. As the user annotates some of the identities of people in their collection, patterns of re-occurrence and co-occurrence of different people in different locations and events emerge. The system uses these patterns to generate label suggestions for identities that were not yet annotated. These suggestions can greatly accelerate the process of manual annotation.

    We obtained ground-truth identity annotation for four different photo albums, and used them to test our system. The system proved effective, making very accurate label suggestions, even when the number of suggestions for each photo was limited to five names, and even when only a small subset of the photos was annotated.}

 ,YEAR = "2005"
 ,entered-by = "Rebecca Wesley"
 ,abstract = {Searching photo libraries can be made more satisfying and successful if search results are presented in a way that allows users to gain an overview of the photo categories. Since photo layouts on computer displays are the primary way that users get an overview, we propose a novel approach to show more photos in meaningful groupings. Photo layouts can be linear strips, or zoomable three dimensional arrangements, but the most common form is the flat two-dimensional grid. This paper introduces a novel bi-level hierarchical layout with motivating examples. In a bi-level hierarchy, one region is designated for primary content, which can be a single photo, text, graphic, or combination. Adjacent to that primary region, groups of photos are placed radially in an ordered fashion, such that the relationship of the single primary region to its many secondary regions is immediately apparent. A compelling aspect is the interactive experience in which the layout is dynamically resizable, allowing users to rapidly, incrementally, and reversibly alter the dimensions and content. It can accommodate hundreds of photos in dozens of regions, can be customized in a corner or center layout, and can scale from an element on a web page to a large poster size. On typical displays (1024 x 1280 or 1200 x 1600 pixels), bi-level radial quantum layouts can conveniently accommodate 2-20 regions with tens or hundreds of photos per region.}

This paper presents a content-based processing paradigm of popular song collections to facilitate the realization of a music digital library. The paradigm is built on the automatic extraction of information of interest from music audio signals. Because the vocal part is often the heart of a popular song, we focus on developing techniques to exploit the solo vocal signals underlying an accompanied performance. This supports the necessary functions of a music digital library, namely, music data organization, music information retrieval/recommendation, and copyright protection.}

The research showed that despite having spent several days in face-to-face workshops, the projects PIs and the educators had different tacit understandings of what digital libraries were, that were impeding the projects organizational communication and workflow. I describe how these differences were identified and analyzed, and subsequently addressed and mediated through the design and development of online tools that acted as boundary objects between the PIs and the educators.}

We chose periodicals as our initial foil since they represent a type of material that invites many different kinds of reading and strategies for navigation. Using multiple sources of evidence from the data, we first characterize readers navigation strategies and specific practices as they make their way through the magazines. We then focus on two observed phenomena that occur when people read paper magazines, but are absent in their digital equivalents: the lightweight navigation that readers use unselfconsciously when they are reading a particular article and the approximate navigation readers engage in when they flip multiple pages at a time. Because page-turning is so basic and seems deceptively simple, we dissect the turn of a page, and use it to illustrate the importance and invisibility of lightweight navigation. Finally, we explore the significance of our results for navigational interfaces to digital library materials.}

We argue that most studies of digital libraries and their patrons' needs or desires look at adult users pursuing work-related goals such as collaborative writing task encountered in college or in professional work places. Most studies also examine the problems and issues of research libraries rather than public libraries. Yet children who are growing up digital may not only have different and heretofore unrecognized needs but also may have insights into the needs future library patrons may have. And public libraries, which support a broader public's reading habits, may also need different kinds of tools for their patrons. Because we are working with younger readers, we have focused on supporting active reading but in the context of reading for pleasure. Our results show that the digital library book for young adults can become a "practiced place," by which we mean a site of shared, constructed meaning through the traces that individuals' reading and writing create.}

It goes on to argue that todays manifestation of information overload will require not just better management of information but the creation of space and time for thinking and reflection, an objective that is consonant with Bushs original aims.}

 ,abstract = {

    Some large scale topical digital libraries, such as CiteSeer, harvest online academic documents by crawling open-access archives, university and author homepages, and authors self-submissions. While these approaches have so far built reasonable size libraries, they can suffer from having only a portion of the documents from specific publishing venues. Alternative online resources and techniques that maximally exploit other resources to build the complete document collection of any given publication venue are discussed here.

    We investigate the feasibility of using publication metadata to guide the crawler towards authors homepages to harvest what is missing from a digital library collection. We collect a real-world dataset from two Computer Science publishing venues, involving a total of 593 unique authors over a time frame of 1998 to 2004. We then identify the missing papers that are not indexed by CiteSeer. Using a fully automatic heuristic-based system that has the capability of locating authors homepages and then using focused crawling to download the desired papers, we demonstrate that it is practical to harvest academic papers using a focused crawler that are missing from our digital library. Our harvester achieves a performance with an average recall level of 0.82 overall and 0.75 for those missing documents. Evaluation of the crawlers performance based on the harvest rate shows definite advantages over other crawling approaches and consistently outperforms a defined baseline crawler on a number of measures.}

 ,abstract = {Constructing a Chinese digital library, especially for a historical article archiving, is often bothered by the small character sets supported by the current computer systems. This paper is aimed at resolving the unencoded character problem with a practical and composite approach for Chinese digital libraries. The proposed approach consists of the glyph expression model, the glyph structure database, and supporting tools. With this approach, the following problems can be resolved. First, the extensibility of Chinese characters can be preserved. Second, it would be as easy to generate, input, display, and search unencoded characters as existing ones. Third, it is compatible with existing coding schemes that most computers use. This approach has been utilized by organizations and projects in various application domains including archeology, linguistics, ancient texts, calligraphy and paintings, and stone and bronze rubbings. For example, in Academia Sinica, a very large full-text database of ancient texts called Scripta Sinica has been created using this approach. The Union Catalog of National Digital Archives Project (NDAP) dealt with the unencoded characters encountered when merging the metadata of 12 different thematic domains from various organizations. Also, in Bronze Inscriptions Research Team (BIRT) of Academia Sinica, 3,459 Bronze Inscriptions were added, which is very helpful to the education and research in historic linguistics.}

We have evaluated our proposed disambiguation and assignment methods on a web page collection referenced by the DLESE metadata collection. The results returned by our methods are compared with manually disambiguated place names and place name assignment. It is shown that our proposed place name disambiguation method works well for geo/geo ambiguities. The preliminary results of our place name assignment method indicate promising results given the existence of geo/non-geo ambiguities among place names.}
