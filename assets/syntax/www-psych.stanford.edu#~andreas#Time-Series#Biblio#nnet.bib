Methods for modeling stochastic processes are discussed, and in particular methods for estimating parameters. For complex symbols, higher order models with more parameters give continuously better fit, so additional criteria are
     needed to select a model. The AIC criterion discussed is one method, which
     weights the complexity of the model as well as how well it fits. The other
     key idea is that rather than try to estimate a single value for a parameter
     i.e. max likelihood value, better use of the available data can be used by
     taking a Bayesian approach, assuming some prior distribution for the
     parameter, and then calculating the distribution for that parameter given
     the actual data.}

     such as Hopfield nets and Boltzmann machines, and shows how this can be
     developed, using a mean field approximation, into a system of coupled
     linear differential equations which can be modeled by networks of continuous
     valued analog units. The issues of learning are not addressed.}

storing associations from an environment. He proposes that we measure the
effectiveness of a code by two criteria: 1) Ability to reconstruct original

inputs into n uncorrellated outputs. The code basically attempts to minimize
the sum of the individual entropies (actually the sum of the probability that
a unit is active, while still being reversible.) This appears to be the first
place where the ideas of reconstructibility and entropy minimization to
decorrellate were suggested",

report is not complete, and in parts incoherent. Basically presents a way to
induce probabilistic classes (assumed to be normal, parameters estimated are
mean and standard deviation). The model assumes an a priori distribution over
the set of all models, and makes no assumption about the number of classes.
The Bayesian procedure has a built in bias to favour models with the smallest
number of classes that give good predictive ability. The paper shows how this
bias can be treated as a minimum message length (MML) criterion for choosing a
best model.},

     groups responding to similar signals. The primary cell groups are selectively
     modified by a form of Hebbian learning, to develop more specific secondary
     repertoires. The system of interconnected cell groups is both phasic and reentrant,
     this being essential to his theory of higher mental processes. Higher mental processes
     are developed from the ability to compare a new input with a reentrant previous
     input (which may be external or internal) and in this fashion learn to
     associate complex representations.}

connectionist model with a number of interesting features. The model is based
on deriving good statistical characterizations of complex environments. Main
features - the model is inherently hierarchical, with distributed
representations in lower sections of the hierarchy become progressively more
localized as one moves up the hierarchy. Features are binary, but may also be
unobserved. Associative recall is the process of estimating certain target
features from the values of other observed features. (Note, the representation
of features can also include actions.) The recall process itself is recursive,
unobserved features are estimated from ones already observed, and then in the
next iteration, these newly decided features can be combined with the old ones
to estimate even more unobserved features until the target feature set is
observed.  There are two types of learning: associative learning involves
gathering information about pairwise statistics among features (these are used
as measures of how much features support each other.) The influence of one
feature on another depends on BOTH the pairwise statistics and also on the
experience of that statistic (i.e. how much data it is based on.)  The second
form of learning involves the development of higher order features. The model
is hierarchical, with second level units gathering statistics about first
level correlations, third level, third order statistics etc. Units at the
second level are "committed" to those pairwise statistics which occur most
frequently, and which are most highly correlated with the "direction" units.
(Basic system reward units.) Descriptions of both spatial and temporal coding
modules are describe.}

     ANNOTE = {Presents a model for learning arbitrary associations of binary
     events, of in theory any order. The procedure is a supervised, statistical
     estimation procedure, and the training is done in much the same fashion
     as a Boltz machine, during training statistics are gathered with the inputs
     and outputs clamped, and during performance parameters estimated from these
     statistics model the output based on the current input. The model is probabilistic
     so to get a single answer you must select the most likely answer. The simplest
     conjuctiod is based on a multinomial distribution, which has an exponential
     number of parameters (i.e. one for each possible state). This model is simple
     to understand, but requires exponential hardware, and an exponential number of
     learning trials to update each parameter once. For this special case, the
     maximum likelihood parameter estimates are simply the observed frequencies
     of global states. The scaling problems for the multinomial case are obvious.
     The paper also develops a general form of P-th order conjunctiod, in which
     the model is an exponential model with a parameter for all terms from 1st
     to Pth order. (The Nth order conjuctoid is equivalent to a multinomial). For
     small orders, this fits a model which requires polynomial parameters to be
     estimated, and fits the data up to Pth order. The important results are an
     estimation procedure, which gives a CONDITIONAL MLE estimate of each parameter
     based on the current values of all the other parameters, and the observations.
     The estimation procedure is evidently very efficient (no details are given
     in this paper), and a very fast hardware implementation is suggested. The model
     also allows the incorporation of prior knowledge as a Bayesian bias. One
     thing that is not clear is how good the model will be if the actual data
     is of higher order than the fitted model. The convergence theorem is a 
     bit like the perceptron convergence rule in that the algorithm is guaranteed
     to find the best fitting model, provided the model is of sufficiently high
     order. The nice thing about using CONDITIONAL MLE estimates of the parameters
     is that the parameters are then statistically independant, and can be
     estimated in parallel. Unfortunately, no insight is given as to whether
     these conditional estimates converge to an unconditionally optimal set
     of parameter values.}

     formal analyses of scaling properties are needed. Suggests that the brain

     generate networks that solve much larger versions of the same problem. The approach

on massively parallel machines is that it is often quite difficult to
simulate the large number of connections with only the limited
communication capabilities of SIMD (single instruction multiple data)
machines like the Connection Machine. For instance, processors in the
Connection Machine can only communicate with their immediate neighbors
in a 2-D grid. Neural networks are currently simulated on the
connection machine by using the router which allows a processor to
talk to any other. The router is expensive however in terms of speed
and space. This paper presents a scheme for implementing neural nets
with arbitrary connections on machines with very limited processor
communication. The algorithm is both interesting and quite efficient.
A very good paper if you are interested in this sort of thing.

		Connectionist models inherently include features and exhibit
		behaviors which are difficult to achieve with traditional logic-based models.
		Among the more important characteristics are:
		(1) the ability to compute nearest match rather than requiring
		unification or exact match; (2) learning; (3) fault tolerance
		through the integration of overlapping modules, each of which
		may be incomplete or fallible, and (4) the possibility of scaling 
		up such systems by many orders of magnitude, to operate more
		rapidly or to handle much larger problems, or both.  However,
		it is unlikely that connectionist models will be able to learn
		all of language from experience, because it is unlikely that a
		full cognitive system could be built via learning from an initially
		random network; any successful large-scale connectionist learning
		system will have to be to some degree ``genetically'' prewired."
