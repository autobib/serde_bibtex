  abstract = {{T}he analysis of spatial pattern in plant ecology usually implies the solution of some edge effect problems. {W}e present in this paper some explicit formulas of edge effect correction that should enable plant ecologists to analyse a wider range of real field data. {W}e consider the local correcting factor of edge effect for {R}ipley's {K}-function, that can also be used for other statistics of spatial analysis based on the counting of neighbours within a given distance. {F}or both circular and rectangular study areas, we provide a review of explicit formulas and an extension of these formulas for long and narrow plots. {I}n the case of irregular-shaped study plots, we propose a generalization of the method that computes edge effect correction by excluding triangular surfaces from a simple (rectangular or circular) initial shape. {A}n example in forest ecology, where the soil characteristics determine a study plot of complex shape, illustrates how this edge effect correction can be effective in avoiding misinterpretations.
