  abstract	= {Several estimation methods have been proposed for
		  identifying errors-in-variables systems, where both input
		  and output measurements are corrupted by noise. One of the
		  promising approaches is the so called Frisch scheme. This
		  paper provides an accuracy analysis of the Frisch scheme
		  applied to system identification. The estimates of the
		  system parameters and the noise variances are shown to be
		  asymptotically Gaussian distributed. An explicit expression
		  for the covariance matrix of the asymptotic distribution is
		  given as well. Numerical simulations support the
		  theoretical results. A comparison with the Cramer-Rao lower
		  bound is also given in examples, and it is shown that the
		  Frisch scheme gives a performance close to the Cramer-Rao
		  bound for large signal-to-noise ratios. }
