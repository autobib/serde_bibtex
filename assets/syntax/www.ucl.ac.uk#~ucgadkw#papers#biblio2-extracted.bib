                  Chronologically it covers everything
                  from the Vedic period up to the Hindu
                  kingdoms before the establishment of
                  Muslim rule. If relevant, the reader
                  will regularly find sidesteps to modern
                  continuities. The role of the oral
                  tradition and the techniques of
                  memorization are discussed, along with
                  education in small private tutorials and
                  the development of large monasteries and
                  temple schools approaching university
                  character. Professional training, the
                  role of the teacher and of foreign
                  languages are dealt with, and the impact
                  of the peculiar features of Indian
                  education on Indian society.\\ pp.119ff.

  abstract     = {Although in Chinese culture surgery has
                  not usually been seen as a major part of
                  medical practice, during the Sui (A.D.
                  581-618) and the Tang dynasties (A.D.
                  618-907), it showed a marked flowering
                  in the field of ophthalmology. Chinese
                  historical records, popular literature
                  and medical works and compilations
                  indicate that it was closely related to
                  Indian medicine. The origins of this
                  transmission can be traced to early
                  Chinese Buddhist canonical literature.
                  Chinese and Indian ophthalmological
                  works of the time are studied here,
                  especially ophthalmic diseases like
                  pterygium, entropion or trichiasis and
                  cataract, which often call for surgical
                  intervention as a way of giving curative
                  or palliative treatment. The texts
                  reflect upon the origin, route and
                  nature of this transmission, and vividly
                  depict the gradual introduction of
                  various aspects of surgery into Chinese
                  medicine. Indian medicine was thus a
                  prominent contributor to the development
                  of Chinese medicine and, especially,
                  surgery from the seventh century A.D.

                  rise and fall of Sanskrit, India's
                  ancient language, as a vehicle of poetry
                  and polity. He traces the two great
                  moments of its transformation: the first
                  around the beginning of the Common Era,
                  when Sanskrit, long a sacred language,
                  was reinvented as a code for literary
                  and political expression, the start of
                  an amazing career that saw Sanskrit
                  literary culture spread from Afghanistan
                  to Java. The second moment occurred
                  around the beginning of the second
                  millennium, when local speech forms
                  challenged and eventually replaced
                  Sanskrit in both the literary and
                  political arenas. Drawing striking
                  parallels, chronologically as well as
                  structurally, with the rise of Latin
                  literature and the Roman empire, and
                  with the new vernacular literatures and
                  nation-states of late-medieval Europe,
                  <i>The Language of the Gods in the World
                  of Men</i> asks whether these very
                  different histories challenge current
                  theories of culture and power and
                  suggest new possibilities for practice.},

                  rest of the world" for European
                  readerships?<br> <br> How does one speak
                  of transculturation from the colonies to
                  the metropolis?<br> <br> Studies in
                  colonial and exploration discourse have
                  identified the enormous significance of
                  travel writing as an ideological
                  apparatus of Empire. The study of travel
                  writing has, however, remained either
                  naively celebratory or dismissive,
                  treating texts as symptoms of imperial
                  ideologies.<br> <br>
                  <b></b><b><i>Imperial Eyes</i></b>
                  explores European travel and exploration
                  writing, in connection with European
                  economic and political expansion since
                  1700. It is both a study in genre, and a
                  critique of ideology. Pratt examines how
                  travel books by Europeans create the
                  domestic subject of European
                  imperialism, and how they engage
                  metropolitan reading publics with
                  expansionist enterprises whose material
                  benefits accrued mainly to the very few.
                  These questions are addressed through
                  readings of particular travel accounts
                  connected with particular historical
                  transitions, from the eighteenth century
                  to Paul Theroux: sentimental travel
                  writing and its links with abolitionist
                  rhetoric, discursive reinventions of
                  South America during the period of its
                  independence (1800-1840), and
                  eighteenth-century European writings on
                  Southern Africa in the context of inland
                  expansion.</P>}},

                  have this beautifully illustrated record
                  of Babur's wonderment at the new places

                  India is a land of enormous diversity.
                  Cross-cultural influences are everywhere
                  in evidence, in the food people eat, the
                  clothes they wear, and in the places
                  they worship. This was especially the
                  case in the India that existed from 1200
                  to 1750, before the European
                  intervention. The book takes the reader
                  on a journey across the political,
                  economic, religious and cultural
                  landscapes of medieval India, from the
                  Ghurid conquests and the Dehli Sultanate
                  to the great court of the Mughals. This
                  was a time of conquest and
                  consolidation, when Muslims and Hindus
                  came together to create a unique culture
                  which still resonates in today's India.
                  As the first survey of its kind in over
                  a decade, the book is a tour de force.
                  It is beautifully illustrated and
                  fluently composed, with a cast of
                  characters which will educate students
                  and general readers alike. \\- Covers a
                  critical period of modern India's
                  formation from 1200 to 1750 \\- Written
                  in an accessible and engaging manner,
                  the book is ideally suited for general
                  readers and students seeking an overview
                  of South Asia \\- With numerous features
                  including: photographs of monuments,
                  paintings, and artefacts, glossary of
                  Indian terms, list of biographies of
                  prominent people, and over ten maps.

                  during the latter half of the nineteenth
                  century. Premodern hospitals, according
                  to many scholars, existed mainly as
                  refuges for the desperately poor and
                  sick, providing patients with little or
                  no medical care. Challenging this view
                  in a compelling survey of hospitals in
                  the East Roman Empire, Timothy Miller
                  traces the birth and development of
                  Byzantine <I>xenones</I>, or hospitals,
                  from their emergence in the fourth
                  century to their decline in the
                  fifteenth century, just prior to the
                  Turkish conquest of Constantinople.
                  These sophisticated medical facilities,
                  he concludes, are the true ancestors of
                  modern hospitals. In a new introduction
                  to this paperback edition, Miller
                  describes the growing scholarship on
                  this subject in recent years.},

  abstract     = {{How do the ways historians divide up
                  their subject affect their work, and how
                  have these divisions changed over the
                  years? Why have certain fields, such as
                  women's history and Black history,
                  generated such intense debate about
                  their value and validity? Is history a
                  subject that primarily appropriates its
                  theory from other disciplines? And what
                  is the nature of the links between
                  history and related disciplines, such as
                  anthropology and literary theory? In
                  this lively and readable study, Ludmilla
                  Jordanova examines the many changes in
                  the study of history in recent decades.
                  The nature and implications of the
                  changes remain hotly contested, and
                  Jordanova proves a reliable guide to the
                  emerging discipline. She looks at what
                  historians do, how their work is used in
                  the wider world, and how their methods
                  are continuing to evolve. Ideal for
                  undergraduates and general readers, the
                  book provides an essential theoretical
                  framework for anyone pursuing the study
                  of history.}},

                  leading thinkers in the social sciences
                  and humanities today. Since the
                  publication of his first important
                  articles some two decades ago, debate
                  has continued to develop over his
                  distinctive contributions to
                  contemporary political philosophy, the
                  history of political theory, the
                  philosophy of social science, and the
                  discussion of interpretation and
                  hermeneutics across the humanities and
                  social sciences. Nevertheless, his most
                  valuable essays and the best critical
                  articles concerning his work have been
                  scattered in various journals and
                  difficult to obtain. Meaning and Context
                  includes five of the most widely
                  discussed articles by Skinner, which
                  present his approach to the study of
                  political thought and the interpretation
                  of texts. Following these are seven
                  articles by his critics, five of these
                  drawn from earlier publications and two,
                  by John Keane and Charles Taylor,
                  written especially for this volume.
                  Finally, there appears a fifty-seven
                  page reply by Skinner--a major new
                  statement in which he defends and
                  reformulates his method and lays out new
                  lines of research. The editorial
                  introduction provides a systematic
                  overview of the evolution of Skinner's
                  work and of the main reactions to
                  it.</p><p>Besides James Tully, John

                  leading intellectual historians. This
                  collection includes some of his most
                  important philosophical and
                  methodological statements written over
                  the past four decades, each carefully
                  revised for publication in this form. In
                  a series of seminal essays Professor
                  Skinner sets forth the intellectual
                  principles that inform his work. Writing
                  as a practising historian, he considers
                  the theoretical difficulties inherent in
                  the pursuit of knowledge and
                  interpretation, and elucidates the
                  methodology which finds its expression
                  in his two successive volumes. All of
                  Professor Skinner's work is
                  characterised by philosophical power,
                  limpid clarity, and elegance of
                  exposition; these essays, many of which
                  are now recognised classics, provide a
                  fascinating and convenient digest of the
                  development of his thought.}},

                  In a short introductory essay, he
                  outlines the sources of
                  twentieth-century philosophizing, its
                  major themes, and the range of current
                  debates. The remainder of the essays can
                  be seen as his contribution to these
                  debates.\\ Habermas's essay on George
                  Herbert Mead is a focal point of the
                  book. In it he sketches a
                  postmetaphysical, intersubjective
                  approach to questions of individuation

                  efforts to define a middle ground
                  between nostalgic revivals of
                  metaphysical conceptions of reason and

                  previously autonomous regional kingdoms
                  produced significant political, but also
                  literary effects. In this article, I
                  trace the advent of the Mughal political
                  order to the princely state of Orcha
                  (located in what is now north-western
                  Madhya Pradesh) through the eyes of
                  Kesavdas (fl. 1600), the leading poet
                  from that court. Kesavdas is famous in
                  Hindi literary circles as one of the
                  progenitors of the Brajbhasha riti
                  tradition, a constellation of courtly
                  poetic and intellectual practices that
                  flourished in a climate of mixed Mughal
                  and sub-imperial patronage. There is a
                  pronounced tendency to think of
                  Kesavdas\d{M}COs work (and that of most riti
                  poets) as a corpus of baroque, purely
                  decorative poems largely comprising
                  time-worn erotic and devotional themes.
                  This preliminary study of Kesavdas\d{M}COs
                  three historical poems will help to
                  complicate such an understanding by
                  bringing into our conceptual purview a
                  fuller range of riti textual expression.
                  These lesser known works by one of the
                  foremost riti poets are certainly
                  striking for their literary
                  accomplishments, but they also serve as
                  an invaluable window onto a critical
                  moment in Orcha history. They constitute
                  the perfect testing ground for the
                  enterprise of retrieving historical
                  meaning from the literary sources that
                  were the dominant form of pre-modern
                  Indian courtly self-expression, and the
                  methodology employed here is to
                  critically engage both aesthetic and
                  historical perspectives simultaneously.},

                  Ardhakathanak of Banarasidas (a Jain
                  author from Jaunpur), is an
                  autobiographical poem in the Braj Bhasa
                  dialect of Hindi dating from 1641 AD.
                  The article examines the construction of
                  the text, looking at the creative ways
                  in which Banarasidas builds subtle
                  literary devices by exploiting features
                  inherent in Hindi and in the metres
                  chosen for the poem. It is suggested
                  that a conventional critical approach to
                  the poem, following traditional
                  Sanskritic literary categories, can fail
                  to perceive the strengths of this
                  decidely vernacular composition, and
                  that a new methodology of vernacular
                  aesthetics is needed to do it justice.
                  The problems of maintaining the poem\d{M}COs
                  literary qualities in English
                  translation are explored, both by
                  examining published prose versions and
                  by an experiment with metrical English

                  many of the problems besetting us at the
                  turn of the century, yet, paradoxically,
                  we cannot address them without their
                  assistance. This beautifully illustrated
                  book takes a fresh approach to resolving
                  the problems of progress and modernity
                  by reframing science and
                  technology.<br>In an eclectic and highly
                  original study, Turnbull brings together
                  a wide range of traditions as diverse as
                  cathedral building, Micronesian
                  navigation, cartography and turbulence
                  research. He argues that all our
                  differing ways of producing knowledge,
                  including science, are messy, spatial
                  and local. Every culture has its own
                  ways of assembling local knowledge,
                  thereby creating space through the
                  linking of people, practices and places.
                  The spaces we inhabit and assemblages we
                  work with are not as homogeneous and
                  coherent as our modernist perspectives
                  have led us to believe-rather they are
                  complex and heterogeneous motleys.}},

                  prompted the rethinking of History that
                  has gathered pace in the 1990s. Key
                  concepts for the new history are
                  examined through the ideas of leading
                  historians and philosophers since the
                  eighteenth century such as Kant,
                  Nietzsche, Croce, Collingwood, White,
                  Foucault and Derrida including: class;
                  empiricism, hermeneutics, inference,
                  metanarrative, relativism; and
                  teleology. With an introduction setting
                  out the state of the discipline of
                  history today and alphabetical entries
                  on the key ideas, issues and concepts,
                  The Routledge Companion to Historical

                  India of 1871-72 is a short document,
                  around 40 pages of text, which
                  summarises the findings of the first
                  attempt at a census of India made during
                  the British Raj. It is a concise summary
                  of the findings of what attempted to be
                  the first true census of India. There
                  were, as the memorandum indicates, a
                  number of problems encountered: in
                  particular that it was not conducted
                  simultaneously over the whole of India
                  was probably the greatest shortcoming in
                  the undertaking. However, it was a
                  milestone in the development of the
                  census of India and in many senses was
                  the first real census of India. The
                  memorandum also contains much which is
                  indicative of the importance of the
                  census in the creation of categories
                  which became firmly embedded in the
                  consciousness of later census makers,
                  and in the colonial conceptulisation of
                  India. It contains not only substantial
                  amounts of numerical data on the matters
                  enumerated but also delightful anecdotal
                  details concerning India at the time. },

  abstract     = {Preface: The postulates that follow have
                  been established as basic premises on
                  which the solid edifice of ancient
                  Ayurveda has been based and built. 1.
                  The Mind-Soul-Body complex forms the
                  basic Tripod of Life. 2. The
                  Pancha-maha-bhutas, plus the
                  Soul-Mind-Time-Direction colossus go to
                  form the basic nine Dravyas (material
                  entities). 3. The qualities or Gunas
                  inherent in them are forty-five in
                  number -- but roughly twenty (ten pairs
                  of opposites dualities) of them are of
                  routine practical importance, as has
                  been sumarised by the pragmatic
                  Vagbhatacharya (vide Ashtanga Hridaya,
                  Sutra 1:19). 4. Karma, i.e. the action
                  resulting from these Gunas is specific
                  and facilitates building up of the
                  framework of Ayurvedic methods of
                  prevention and cure of disease. In fact,
                  the Dravya-Guna-Karma complex is
                  responsible fro maintaining
                  ``homeo-stasis'', i.e., the internal,
                  ecological, and physiological balance
                  and harmony. 5. The gross body and the
                  subtle mind are liable to disease and
                  ill-health. The Tridoshas
                  (Wata-Pitta-Kapha) are bodily Doshas
                  (vitiators) just as Raja and Tama are
                  the mental ones. Their balanced harmony
                  is essential for somato-psychic health
                  and well-being, while their disharmony
                  spells disease, ill-health, and finally
                  death. These premises are based on the
                  ancient ``physics and chemistry"
                  adumbrated in the famous
                  Nyaya-Vaisheshika Darshanas as well as
                  the cause-effect complex of Kapila's
                  Samkhya Darshana and the micro-neurology
                  of the Yoga Shastras. The triad of
                  biologically active and universally
                  present organic principles, classically
                  called the Tridosha, are the very basic,
                  organized, vital forces, functioning
                  throughout cosmic creation. Such Divine
                  Dynamism is the common denominator,
                  notably for Yoga and Ayurveda, together
                  with the allied arts and sciences of the
                  ancient, omniscient Hindu saints and
                  seers. The Modern "Unified Field
                  Theory", so valid and true at the gross,
                  physical, mundane level, is also subtly
                  so in matters divine and fields
                  spiritual.},

                  have been associated with the use of
                  Ayurvedic herbal medicine product
                  (HMPs). OBJECTIVES: To determine the
                  prevalence and concentration of heavy
                  metals in Ayurvedic HMPs manufactured in
                  South Asia and sold in Boston-area
                  stores and to compare estimated daily
                  metal ingestion with regulatory
                  standards. DESIGN AND SETTING:
                  Systematic search strategy to identify
                  all stores 20 miles or less from Boston
                  City Hall that sold Ayurvedic HMPs from
                  South Asia by searching online Yellow
                  Pages using the categories markets,
                  supermarkets, and convenience stores,
                  and business names containing the word
                  India, Indian cities, and Indian words.
                  An online national directory of Indian
                  grocery stores, a South Asian community
                  business directory, and a newspaper were
                  also searched. We visited each store and
                  purchased all unique Ayurvedic HMPs
                  between April 25 and October 24, 2003.
                  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations
                  (microg/g) of lead, mercury, and arsenic
                  in each HMP as measured by x-ray
                  fluorescence spectroscopy. Estimates of
                  daily metal ingestion for adults and
                  children estimated using manufacturers'
                  dosage recommendations with comparisons
                  to US Pharmacopeia and US Environmental
                  Protection Agency regulatory standards.
                  RESULTS: A total of 14 (20%) of 70 HMPs
                  (95% confidence interval, 11%-31%)
                  contained heavy metals: lead (n = 13;
                  median concentration, 40 microg/g;
                  range, 5-37,000), mercury (n = 6; median
                  concentration, 20,225 microg/g; range,
                  28-104,000), and/or arsenic (n = 6;
                  median concentration, 430 microg/g;
                  range, 37-8130). If taken as recommended
                  by the manufacturers, each of these 14
                  could result in heavy metal intakes
                  above published regulatory standards.
                  CONCLUSIONS: One of 5 Ayurvedic HMPs
                  produced in South Asia and available in
                  Boston South Asian grocery stores
                  contains potentially harmful levels of
                  lead, mercury, and/or arsenic. Users of
                  Ayurvedic medicine may be at risk for
                  heavy metal toxicity, and testing of
                  Ayurvedic HMPs for toxic heavy metals
                  should be mandatory.},

                  medicine that has stood the test of time
                  From a talk given at Asia House by the
                  Associate Curator for South Asian
                  Collections at the Wellcome Library in
                  London 24 July 2001 The classical
                  medicine of India, ayurveda in Sanskrit,
                  is highly systematic. Today, ayurveda is
                  beginning to take a place in the West
                  alongside other complementary and
                  alternative therapies. This is happening
                  fast, and as it does so, ayurveda is
                  changing, and to some extent being
                  dumbed down. Thus, what we can easily
                  find out about it today is often only
                  its teaching that the body's wellbeing
                  is a function of three humours, wind,
                  bile and phlegm. There is a great deal
                  more to ayurveda than this, and I would
                  like to convey, if I can, a sense of the
                  complexity and subtlety of this medical
                  system in its original setting.
                  Ayurvedic medicine is old, with roots
                  going back to the time of the Buddha,
                  who - according to the latest
                  scholarship - probably died in about 400
                  BC. From its beginnings at this time,
                  ayurvedic theory and practice was
                  gradually developed and formalised
                  until, about 2,000 years ago, several
                  huge medical encyclopedias were compiled
                  in Sanskrit, the precise and beautiful
                  classical language of India. Three of
                  these have survived up to the present;
                  several other major works have been lost
                  forever. But the works that survived are
                  substantial, and cover a wide range of
                  topics, from diagnosis through therapy,
                  herbal medicine, and even refined
                  surgery. In subsequent centuries,
                  ayurvedic literature and practice
                  continued to evolve, with thousands of
                  textbooks, monographs, dictionaries, and
                  other works being written, right up to
                  the 19th century. New ayurvedic works in
                  Sanskrit are occasionally composed even
                  now, though they are virtuoso gestures
                  to a glorious tradition rather than
                  organic products of a living system of
                  medicine. In addition to the extensive
                  formal herbal knowledge available in the
                  ayurvedic tradition, therapies such as
                  oil massage, evacuations, cleansing, and
                  exercise are all discussed in detail.
                  Great attention is paid to the
                  interaction between the personal
                  constitution of the patient, the time,
                  and the diet. The patient's regimen must
                  change with the time of the year, and
                  the food eaten and the exercise taken
                  must be in sympathy with it. Thus, hot
                  foods are prescribed for winter, and
                  cooling foods for summer. Ayurveda is
                  not homeopathic: treatment is a matter
                  of balancing out opposing forces in the
                  body, and restoring equilibrium. These
                  ideas are not, however, just vague
                  well-meaning suggestions. Traditionally,
                  it took 12 years to train an ayurvedic
                  physician. In this time, the physician
                  would become extremely proficient in
                  herbal lore, but would also learn about
                  the six flavours that are present in
                  every food, and how these flavours can
                  inflame or pacify the humours. The
                  student would learn about the 20
                  physical qualities of every medicinal
                  substance, and about its two potencies,
                  and the changes that would take place in
                  the effect of a medicine as it underwent
                  digestion. It is only in the last few
                  decades that the traditional medicine of
                  India itself has begun to find a wide
                  and receptive audience outside India,
                  especially in the United States,
                  Britain, Italy, and Germany. But only a
                  fraction of the medical wisdom of
                  ayurveda is represented as it comes into
                  our shops in London and Manhattan. In
                  both India and Sri Lanka today, ayurveda
                  is officially supported at the
                  government level. It forms a respected
                  component of national healthcare
                  provision, although the proportion of
                  the health budget spent on ayurveda is
                  small compared with that spent on
                  biomedicine. There are government
                  colleges, clinics, hospitals, and
                  accredited programs of professional
                  training, qualification and licensing.
                  Outside South Asia, ayurveda is having
                  to find its place in a different
                  marketplace, that of complementary and
                  alternative medicine. As this happens,
                  it is becoming imperative that
                  practitioners and medical suppliers
                  organise into professional associations
                  in order to provide the accreditation
                  and validation necessary to participate
                  in the modern medical
                  marketplace.\end{quote}},

                  devoted to the improvement of his pupil.
                  Sherfoji became a scholar in English. He
                  was also taught Marathi and Tamil. \par
                  As Amar Singh was still plotting against
                  Sherfoji, Sherfoji and his family were
                  removed to Madras. Sherfoji was treated
                  with great honour by the English at
                  Madras. The English also instituted an
                  enquiry as to the adoption of Sherfoji.
                  Sherfoji himself adduced before the
                  company the true scriptural evidence ot
                  support his adoption. The English
                  satisfied themselves about the
                  genuineness and authoritative character
                  of the scriptural evidence by enquiring
                  in various places in India including
                  Benares. The Version of Amar Singh and
                  his Pundits was also considered.
                  Schwartz also reported that the Pundits
                  recanted their original opinion. \par
                  Soon after, Schwartz died. [ca.1797 or
                  1798] Sherfoji was filled with grief.
                  Ref.\ Gerick succeeded Schwartz. Gerick
                  also was greatly attached to Sherfoji.

                  alternative medicine is everywhere. A
                  recent survey found that more than two
                  in five Americans uses some form of
                  alternative medicine. The Politics of
                  Healing brings together top scholars in
                  the fields of American history, history
                  of medicine, anthropology, sociology,
                  and politics to counter the view that
                  alternative medical therapies fell into
                  disrepute in the decades after
                  physicians established their
                  institutional authority during the
                  Progressive Era. From homeopathy to
                  Navajo healing, this volume explores a
                  variety of alternative therapies and
                  political movements that have set the
                  terms of debate over North American
