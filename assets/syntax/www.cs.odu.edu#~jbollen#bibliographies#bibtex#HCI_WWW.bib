@ARTICLE{findin:gordon1998,
  author = {Michael Gordon and Praveen Pathak},
  year = 1998,
  title = {Finding Information on the World Wide Web: The Retrieval
          Effectiveness of Search Engines},
  journal = {Information Processing and Management},
  volume = 35,
  pages = {141-180},
  abstract = {The authors have tested the retrieval "recall" and "precision"
             of 8 major search engines. They conducted an experiment that was
             setup to involve two groups of people: group A that generated a
             set of user information needs as specified in a query that
             allowed user to indicate their interests in terms of a
             description, keywords, boolean query and list of synonyms. Group
             B then conducted the actual searches with this information on all
             8 search engines (Altavista. Lycos, Excite, Hotbot, Yahoo, etc).
             Group B was told to find the query that produced the best search
             results for each search engine, using its specific search
             features, expanding the set of keywords, using information from
             other search engine's results to produce better queries etc. The
             final results were a list of 200 results for each search engine.
             Group A was then required to evaluate the relevancy of the
             randomized list of the top 20 results for each engine. Precision
             and recall values were calculated based on these assesments Major
             results: small statistical differences among search engines,
             Altavista, Lycos and Open Text scored better than all others.
             Yahoo was worst in terms of precision and recall. Small overlap
             between search engine's results, number of relevant document
             ranged around 1/10, no individual differences indicating the
             quality of the query and engine specific query capabilities are
             of small influence, the authors suggest the application of
             meta-search engines.}

                  user-machine interaction. By applying costs (time) and
                  values (number of documents retrieved) to specific
                  transitions and positions in a walk through an
                  example state-space, the authors present
                  the results from a test of this technique with a
                  browser developed by the author. The state-space
                  approach models the selections a user can make and
                  applying costs and benefits to every point in his
                  path. By recursively analyzing the state-space of
                  possible paths, the authors propose user-interfaces
                  and the web can be modeled and improved.}

      incorporates new methods of Web site visualization (Dome

      technique for Web site use (Web User Flow by Information
      Scent, WUFIS), and new Web usability metrics.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{usingi:chi2001,
title = {Using information scent to model user information needs and
      actions and the Web},
author = {H. Chi and Peter Pirolli and Kim Chen and James Pitkow},
year = 2001,
booktitle = {{C}onference on {H}uman {F}actors and {C}omputing {S}ystems},
month  = {April},
pages = {490 -- 497},
address  = {Seattle, WA},
abstract = {On the Web, users typically forage for information by
      navigating from page to page along Web links. Their
      surfing patterns or actions are guided by their
      information needs. Researchers need tools to explore the
      complex interactions between user needs, user actions,
      and the structures and contents of the Web. In this
      paper, we describe two computational methods for
      understanding the relationship between user needs and
      user actions. First, for a particular pattern of surfing,
      we seek to infer the associated information need. Second,
      given an information need, and some pages as starting
      pints, we attempt to predict the expected surfing
      patterns. The algorithms use a concept called
      "information scent", which is the subjective sense of
      value and cost of accessing a page based on perceptual
      cues. We present an empirical evaluation of these two
      algorithms, and show their effectiveness.},

@ARTICLE{mental:thatcher1998,

author = {Andrew Thatcher and Mike Greyling},
year = 1998,
journal = {International Journal of Industrial Ergonomics},
volume = {22},
pages = {299 -- 305},
abstract = {As the amount of knowledge and the number of users connected to the Internet rapidly expands so the
     need to understand how users conceptualize this giant network becomes more important. Through the
     medium of sophisticated software interfaces users must navigate through cyberspace and access relevant
     information. Access to the user's mental model of the Internet will enable designers and information
     technologists to better understand and structure the knowledge deposits of the future. This study
     explores the use of drawings to access users' mental models of the Internet from a group of South
     African's with varying experience with the Internet and computers. Mental models from 51 University
     respondents were categorized by three independent raters. The mental models were arranged into six
     categories. Analyses on these categories suggest that the mental model categories may be
     hierarchically ordered according to respondents' experience with the Internet. These results are
     discussed in terms of the organization of knowledge on the Internet and in terms of designing Internet
     interfaces.}
