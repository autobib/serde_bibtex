  abstract = {Modern experimental technology enables the identification of the sensory
	proteins that interact with the cells' environment or various pathogens.
	Expression and knockdown studies can determine the downstream effects
	of these interactions. However, when attempting to reconstruct the
	signaling networks and pathways between these sources and targets,
	one faces a substantial challenge. Although pathways are directed,
	high-throughput protein interaction data are undirected. In order
	to utilize the available data, we need methods that can orient protein
	interaction edges and discover high-confidence pathways that explain
	the observed experimental outcomes. We formalize the orientation
	problem in weighted protein interaction graphs as an optimization
	problem and present three approximation algorithms based on either
	weighted Boolean satisfiability solvers or probabilistic assignments.
	We use these algorithms to identify pathways in yeast. Our approach
	recovers twice as many known signaling cascades as a recent unoriented
	signaling pathway prediction technique and over 13 times as many
	as an existing network orientation algorithm. The discovered paths
	match several known signaling pathways and suggest new mechanisms
	that are not currently present in signaling databases. For some pathways,
	including the pheromone signaling pathway and the high-osmolarity
	glycerol pathway, our method suggests interesting and novel components
	that extend current annotations.},

	distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density
	estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal's
	algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove
	an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator
	relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we
	consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes.
	We prove that finding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted
	tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for
	this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we
	then select a forest using cross-validation, and prove bounds on
	excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure.},
