  abstract = {Interest in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has recently increased,
	that is, interest in the problem of recovering the reward function
	underlying a Markov decision process (MDP) given the dynamics of
	the system and the behavior of an expert. This paper deals with an
	incremental approach to online IRL. First, the convergence property
	of the incremental method for the IRL problem was investigated, and
	the bounds of both the mistake number during the learning process
	and regret were provided by using a detailed proof. Then an online
	algorithm based on incremental error correcting was derived to deal
	with the I R L problem. The key idea is to add an increment to the
	current reward estimate each time an action mismatch occurs. This
	leads to an estimate that approaches a target optimal value. The
	proposed method was tested in a driving simulation experiment and
	found to be able to efficiently recover an adequate reward function.},
