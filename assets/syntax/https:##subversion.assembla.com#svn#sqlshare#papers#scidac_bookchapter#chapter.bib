@inproceedings{howe:iimas:08,
	abstract = {Traditional data integration and analysis approaches tend to assume intimate familiarity with the structure, semantics, and capabilities of the available information sources before applicable tools can be used effectively. This assumption often does not hold in practice. We introduce dataspace profiling as the cardinal activity when beginning a project in an unfamiliar dataspace. Dataspace profiling is an analysis of the structures and properties exposed by an information source, allowing 1) assessment of the utility and importance of the information source as a whole, 2) assessment of compatibility with the services of a dataspace support platform, and 3) determination and externalization of structure in preparation for specific data applications. In this paper, we define dataspace profiling and articulate requirements for dataspace profilers. We then describe the Quarry system, which offers a generic browse-and-query interface to support dataspace profiling activities, including path profiling, over a variety of data sources with minimal setup costs and minimal a priori assumptions. We show that the mechanisms used in Quarry deliver strong performance in large-scale applications. Specifically, we use Quarry to efficiently profile 1) a detailed standard for medication nomenclature supplied under a generic schema and 2) the metadata for an environmental observation and forecasting system, and conclude that in these contexts Quarry offers advantages over existing tools.},

The best argument for scientific visualization is that today's researchers must consume ever higher volumes of numbers that gush, as if from a fire hose, out of supercomputer simulations or high-powered scientific instruments. If researchers try to read the data, usually presented as vast numeric matrices, they will take in the information at snail's pace. If the information is rendered graphically, however, they can assimilate it at a much faster rate Rapid advances in 3-D scientific visualization have made a major impact on the display of data/information.}},

  abstract =	"The search for intersected cells in isocontouring can
		 be accelerated using suitable range query data
		 structures, such as the interval tree or segment tree.
		 The storage overhead of such search structures can be
		 significantly reduced by searching over a subset of the
		 cells {\"E}, called a seed set, which contains at least
		 one cell per connected component of every isocontour.
		 We present three algorithms for generating seed sets
		 and compare their time complexity and performance in
		 terms of the number of seed cells generated. The first
		 two algorithms are applicable to both regular and
		 irregular grids of arbitrary dimension, while the third
		 is a specialization for regular grids. The first
		 algorithm produces a nearly optimal seed set,
		 minimizing the storage overhead for the search
		 structure. While the second and third algorithms may
		 produce a larger seed set, they are extremely fast,
		 have the advantage of being suitable for extremely
		 large datasets that cannot be kept in main memory
		 (out-of-core computation), and are amenable to
		 parallelization. In each case the resulting seed sets
		 are orders of magnitude smaller than the total number
		 of cells, while the computational complexity remains
		 optimal. We compare the results of the two new
		 algorithms with previous results and recent new work.

		 for speeding up isosurface extraction. Even though
		 there exist algorithms that can achieve optimal search
		 performance to identify isosurface cells, they prove
		 impractical for large datasets due to a high storage
		 overhead. With the dual goals of achieving fast
		 isosurface extraction and simultaneously reducing the
		 space requirement, we introduce an algorithm based on
		 transform coding to compress the interval information
		 of the cells in a dataset. Compression is achieved by
		 first transforming the cell intervals (minima, maxima)
		 into a form which allows more efficient compaction. It
		 is followed by a dataset optimized non-uniform
		 quantization stage. The compressed data is stored in a
		 data structure that allows fast searches in the
		 compression domain, thus eliminating the need to
		 retrieve the original representation of the intervals
		 at run-time. The space requirement of our search data
		 structure is the mandatory cost of storing every cell
		 ID once, plus an overhead for quantization information.
		 The overhead is typically in the order of a few
		 hundredths of the dataset size.",

		 value. We propose the application of such a data
		 structure to the fast location of cells intersected by
		 an isosurface in a volume dataset. The resulting search
		 method can be applied to both structured and
		 unstructured volume datasets, and it can be applied
		 incrementally to exploit coherence between isosurfaces.
		 We also address issues about storage requirements, and
		 operations other than the location of cells, whose
		 impact is relevant in the whole isosurface extraction
		 task. In the case of unstructured grids, the overhead,
		 due to the search structure, is compatible with the
		 storage cost of the dataset, and local coherence in the
		 computation of isosurface patches is exploited through
		 a hash table. In the case of a structured dataset, a
		 new conceptual organization is adopted, called the
		 chess-board approach, which exploits the regular
		 structure of the dataset to reduce memory usage and to
		 exploit local coherence. In both cases, efficiency in
		 the computation of surface normals on the isosurface is
		 obtained by a precomputation of the gradients at the
		 vertices of the mesh. Experiments on different kinds of
		 input show that the practical performance of the method
		 reflects its theoretical optimality.",
