                  is a practical framework for formal semantic
                  description of programming languages. Since its
                  appearance ten years ago, Action Semantics has been
                  used to describe major languages such as Pascal,
                  SML, ANDF, and Java, and various tools for
                  processing action semantic descriptions have been
                  developed.\bibpar The AS~2002 workshop Proceedings
                  includes contributed papers on recent development
                  and applications of tool support for Action
                  Semantics, on ways of increasing the modularity of
                  action semantic descriptions and the definition of
                  Action Notation, on analysis of information flow and
                  types of actions, and on test suite generation based
                  on Abstract State Machines. It also includes an
                  invited paper by Egon B{\"o}rger with a comparative
                  study of computation and specification models",
