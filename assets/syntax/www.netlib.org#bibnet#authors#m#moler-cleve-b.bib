  abstract =     "MATLAB is a high-level language oriented towards
                 scientific and engineering applications. It has evolved
                 over a ten-year history to become a popular, flexible,
                 powerful, but still simple language, and has served as
                 an effective platform for over a dozen ``toolboxes''
                 supporting everything from symbolic computation to
                 digital filter design, control theory and neural nets.
                 Designed to be used interactively, MATLAB also supports
                 the ability to define functions and scripts, and
                 dynamically link with C and FORTRAN programs. This
                 paper discusses a project to provide a compiler for
                 MATLAB. The focus of this paper is on techniques that
                 might be useful for other high-level languages, and the
                 parts of such languages that resist compilation. Our
                 constructed MATLAB compiler is in beta test, and has
                 demonstrated speedups over interpretation of up to 300
                 times on practical programs",

                 solvers for use in both MATLAB and SIMULINK. They are
                 compatible with the old methods of the same names, and
                 are still intended for non-stiff systems, but they have
