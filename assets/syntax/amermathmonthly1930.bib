%%%                        Data for the bibliography has been collected

%%%                        The Editorial Office of this journal is
%%%                        fortuitously located in my Department, so I
%%%                        am collaborating with the Editorial Staff to
%%%                        provide advance listing (typically about four
%%%                        months) of papers before they actually appear
%%%                        in print.  Naturally, such entries are
%%%                        subject to revision after publication,
%%%                        notably to provide the missing page numbers.
%%%
%%%                        Work is also in progress to extend coverage
%%%                        of the bibliography collection for this
%%%                        journal back to its initial 1894 volume, and
%%%                        to provide annual, decennial, and cumulative
%%%                        indexes of the journal on the World-Wide Web.
%%%                        However, this work is likely to take several
