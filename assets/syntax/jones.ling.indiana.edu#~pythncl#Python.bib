@article{Dubois:1996:NP,
	Abstract = {Python is a small and easy-to-learn language with
  surprising capabilities. It is an interpreted
  object-oriented scripting language and has a full range
  of sophisticated features such as first-class
  functions, garbage collection, and exception handling.
  Python has properties that make it especially appealing
  for scientific programming: Python is quite simple and
  easy to learn, but it is a full and complete language.
  It is simple to extend Python with your own compiled
  objects and functions. Python is portable, from Unix to
  Windows 95 to Linux to Macintosh. Python is free, with
  no license required even if you make a commercial
  product out of it. Python has a large user-contributed
  library of ``modules''. These modules cover a wide
  variety of needs, such as audio and image processing,
  World Wide Web programming, and graphical user
  interfaces. In particular, there is an interface to the
  popular Tk package for building windowing applications.
  And now, Python has a high-performance array module
  similar to the facilities in specialized array
  languages such as Matlab, IDL, Basis, or Yorick. This
  extension also adds complex numbers to the language.
  Array operations in Python lead to the execution of
  loops in C, so that most of the work is done at full
  compiled speed.},

	Abstract = {Python is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented
  programming language. It supports a wide range of
  applications, from simple text processing scripts to
  interactive WWW browsers. While the Python Reference
  Manual describes the exact syntax and semantics of the
  language, it does not describe the standard library
  that is distributed with the language, and which
  greatly enhances its immediate usability. This library
  contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide
  access to system functionality such as file I/O that
  would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers,
  as well as modules written in Python that provide
  standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
  everyday programming. Some of theses modules are
  explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the
  portability of Python programs. This library reference
  manual documents Python's standard library, as well as
  many optional library modules (which may or may not be
  available, depending on whether the underlying platform
  supports them and on the configuration choices made at
  compile time). It also documents the standard types of
  the language and its built-in functions and exceptions,
  many of which are not or incompletely documented in the
  Reference Manual. This manual assumes basic knowledge
  about the Python language. For an informal introduction
  to Python, see the Python Tutorial; the Python
  Reference Manual remains the highest authority on
  syntactic and semantic questions. Finally, the manual
  entitled Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter
  describes how to add new extensions to Python and how
  to embed it in other applications.''},

	Abstract = {Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming
  language. This document describes how to write modules
  in C or C++ to extend the Python interpreter with new
  modules. Those modules can define new functions but
  also new object types and their methods. The document
  also describes how to embed the Python interpreter in
  another application, for use as an extension language.
  Finally, it shows how to compile and link extension
  modules so that they can be loaded dynamically (at run
  time) into the interpreter, if the underlying operating
  system supports this feature. This document assumes
  basic knowledge about Python. For an informal
  introduction to the language, see the Python Tutorial.
  The Python Reference Manual gives a more formal
  definition of the language. The Python Library
  Reference documents the existing object types,
  functions and modules (both built-in and written in
  Python) that give the language its wide application
