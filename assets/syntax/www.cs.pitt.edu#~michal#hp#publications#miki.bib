  abstract = {While evidence-based medicine has increasingly broad-based support
	in health care, it remains difficult to get physicians to actually
	practice it. Across most domains in medicine, practice has lagged
	behind knowledge by at least several years. The authors believe that
	the key tools for closing this gap will be information systems that
	provide decision support to users at the time they make decisions,
	which should result in improved quality of care. Furthermore, providers
	make many errors, and clinical decision support can be useful for
	finding and preventing such errors. Over the last eight years the
	authors have implemented and studied the impact of decision support
	across a broad array of domains and have found a number of common
	elements important to success. The goal of this report is to discuss
	these lessons learned in the interest of informing the efforts of
	others working to make the practice of evidence-based medicine a
	reality.},

	and machine learning provide effective technologies for fraud detection
	and have been applied successfully to detect activities such as money
	laundering, e-commerce credit card fraud, telecommunications fraud

	from a set of events captured from a computer system operating under
	normal conditions. The model is then used to recognize unusual activities
	as deviations from normality. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful
	probabilistic finite state machines that have been used to acquire
	these baseline-models. Although previous research has indicated that
	HMMs can effectively represent complex sequences, the traditional
	learning algorithm for HMMs is too computationally expensive for
	use with real-world anomaly detection systems. This paper describes
	the use of a novel incremental learning algorithm for HMMs that allows
	the efficient acquisition of anomaly detection models. The new learning
	algorithm requires less memory and training time than previous approaches
	for learning discrete HMMs and can be used to perform online learning
	of accurate baseline-models from complex computer applications to
	support anomaly detection.},

	characteristic (ROC) curve obtained by the "rating" method, or by

	It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability
	that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked
	with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject.
	Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity
	that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon
	statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid
	closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling
	variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the
	area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size
	of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate
	of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be
	to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy
	of diagnostic techniques.},

  abstract = {{During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation
	and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data
	in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing.
	The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development
	of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such
	as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these
	tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
	terminology. This book descibes theimprtant ideas in these areas
	ina common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical,
	the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples
	are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a vluable
	resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in
	science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised
	learing (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include
	neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
	boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.
	Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors
	of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers
	in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive
	models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much
	of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal
	curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author
	of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman
	is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS,
	and projection pursuit.}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic prescribing systems with decision support may
	improve patient safety in ambulatory care by offering drug allergy
	and drug interaction alerts. However, preliminary studies show that
	clinicians override most of these alerts. METHODS: We performed a
	retrospective analysis of 233 537 medication safety alerts generated
	by 2872 clinicians in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
	who used a common electronic prescribing system from January 1, 2006,
	through September 30, 2006. We used multivariate techniques to examine
	factors associated with alert acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 6.6\%
	of electronic prescription attempts generated alerts. Clinicians
	accepted 9.2\% of drug interaction alerts and 23.0\% of allergy alerts.
	High-severity interactions accounted for most alerts (61.6\%); clinicians
	accepted high-severity alerts slightly more often than moderate-
	or low-severity interaction alerts (10.4\%, 7.3\%, and 7.1\%, respectively;
	P < .001). Clinicians accepted 2.2\% to 43.1\% of high-severity interaction
	alerts, depending on the classes of interacting medications. In multivariable
	analyses, we found no difference in alert acceptance among clinicians
	of different specialties (P = .16). Clinicians were less likely to
	accept a drug interaction alert if the patient had previously received
	the alerted medication (odds ratio, 0.03; 95\% confidence interval,
	0.03-0.03). CONCLUSION: Clinicians override most medication alerts,
	suggesting that current medication safety alerts may be inadequate
	to protect patient safety.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic
	adverse drug reaction caused by heparin. As thrombocytopenia is common
	in hospitalized patients receiving heparin, it would be useful to
	have a clinical scoring system that could differentiate patients
	with HIT from those with other reasons for thrombocytopenia. AIM:
	To compare prospectively the diagnostic utility of a clinical score
	for HIT in two different clinical settings. METHODS: The pretest
	clinical scoring system, the '4 T's', was used to classify 100 consecutive
	patients referred for possible HIT in one hospital (Hamilton General
	Hospital, HGH) into high, intermediate, and low probability groups.
	This system was also used to classify likewise 236 patients by clinicians
	in Germany referring blood for diagnostic testing for HIT in Greifswald
	(GW). The clinical scores were correlated with the results of laboratory
	testing for HIT antibodies using the serologic criteria for HIT with
	high diagnostic specificity. RESULTS: In both centers, patients with
	low scores were unlikely to test positive for HIT antibodies [HGH:
	1/64 (1.6\%), GW: 0/55 (0\%)]. Patients with intermediate [HGH: 8/28
	(28.6\%), GW: 11/139 (7.9\%)] or high scores [HGH: 8/8 (100\%), GW:
	9/42 (21.4\%)] were more likely to test positive for clinically significant
	HIT antibodies. The positive predictive value of an intermediate
	or high clinical score for clinically significant HIT antibodies
	was higher at one center (HGH). CONCLUSIONS: A low pretest clinical
	score for HIT seems to be suitable for ruling out HIT in most situations
	(high-negative predictive value). The implications of an intermediate
	or high score vary in different clinical settings.},

	and prompts on clinicians' prescribing behavior were selected and
	categorized by decision support type. Most alerts and prompts (23
	out of 27) demonstrated benefit in improving prescribing behavior
	and/or reducing error rates. The impact appeared to vary based on
	the type of decision support. Some of these alerts (n = 5) reported
	a positive impact on clinical and health service management outcomes.
	For many categories of reminders, the number of studies was very
	small and few data were available from the outpatient setting. None
	of the studies evaluated features that might make alerts and prompts
	more effective. Details of an updated search run in Jan 2009 are

	We also present novel convex relaxations based on the variational

  abstract = {This chapter about the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced
	thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on
	Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines.
	Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits
	do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests
	that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for
	a full understanding of the grading, see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004;
	126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are
	the following: For patients in whom the risk of HIT is considered
	to be > 0.1\%, we recommend platelet count monitoring (Grade 1C).
	For patients who are receiving therapeutic-dose unfractionated heparin
	(UFH), we suggest at least every-other-day platelet count monitoring
	until day 14, or until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first (Grade
	2C). For patients who are receiving postoperative antithrombotic
	prophylaxis with UFH (HIT risk > 1\%), we suggest at least every-other-day
	platelet count monitoring between postoperative days 4 to 14 (or
	until UFH is stopped, whichever occurs first) [Grade 2C]. For medical/obstetric
	patients who are receiving prophylactic-dose UFH, postoperative patients
	receiving prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),
	postoperative patients receiving intravascular catheter UFH "flushes,"
	or medical/obstetrical patients receiving LMWH after first receiving
	UFH (risk, 0.1 to 1\%), we suggest platelet count monitoring every
	2 days or 3 days from day 4 to day 14, or until heparin is stopped,
	whichever occurs first (Grade 2C). For medical/obstetrical patients
	who are only receiving LMWH, or medical patients who are receiving
	only intravascular catheter UFH flushes (risk < 0.1\%), we suggest
	clinicians do not use routine platelet count monitoring (Grade 2C).
	For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether
	or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend use of an alternative
	anticoagulant, such as lepirudin (Grade 1C+), argatroban (Grade 1C),
	bivalirudin (Grade 2C), or danaparoid (Grade 1B). For patients with
	strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, we recommend routine ultrasonography
	of the lower-limb veins for investigation of deep venous thrombosis
	(Grade 1C); against the use of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [coumarin]
	therapy until after the platelet count has substantially recovered;
	that the VKA antagonist be administered only during overlapping alternative
	anticoagulation (minimum 5-day overlap); and begun with low, maintenance
	doses (all Grade 2C). For patients receiving VKAs at the time of
	diagnosis of HIT, we recommend use of vitamin K (Grade 2C) [corrected]
	For patients with a history of HIT who are HIT antibody negative
	and require cardiac surgery, we recommend use of UFH (Grade 1C).},
