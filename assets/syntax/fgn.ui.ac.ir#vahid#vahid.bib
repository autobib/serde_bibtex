abstract = "-Having taught translation courses, specifically the course, ‘The Application of Idiomatic Expressions to Translation’, for many years, this researcher has experienced great difficulty in translating figurative language to EFL learners. The difficult seems to be irreducible as the learner’s language proficiency develops. At the same time, it seems that in typologically-different languages like English and Farsi, certain tropes cause more problems for EFL learners. On this basis, the present study aims at developing a documented profile of the relationship between the EFL learner’s level of language proficiency an the extent of their ability to understand figurative language, thereby finding answers to the following questions an testing the related hypotheses: Q1: Is there any significant relationship between the learner’s general EFL proficiency and the perception of figurative language ? Q2: Which type of figurative language causes more problems for Iranian EFL learners",

abstract = {-Abstract: This study was an attempt to investigate the nature of metaphor by doing a cross-cultural comparison of metaphor in 2 typologically different languages-English and Persian. For this purpose, animal metaphors were taken for comparison. The "GREAT CHAIN OF BEING" metaphor (Lakoff & Turner, 1989), along with the principle of metaphorical highlighting (Kovecses, 2002), were used as a framework in comparing different aspects of animal metaphors as interpreted by native speakers of the 2 languages. The results showed that although animal metaphors in English and Persian are similar to a certain extent, many aspects of them are culture-specific. The similarities and differences among 44 animal metaphors in these 2 languages are shown and some possible explanations are put forward. },

abstract = "-The translatorof a literary text observes the semantic sense of words, the weight, the cultural setting, and other technical features of the original text to yield andacceptable  translation in the TL.  The accomplishment  however is not that easy, for the translator  meets some major impediments in performing  thetask.A translator who is familiar  with differentcritical approaches, first, interpets the text and then  sees how the message can be conveyed in the TL, from which the reader  is likely to elicit  the same interpretation. Being open to interpretationon differents levels, a literary text challenges the translator who explores the text  meaning and reshapes it in another system. The translator of  a literary text also interprets the text  according to the cultural setting it was written in.  The dominant ideology of the time  does not leave literature unaffected  and much of the semantic weight of the text might have been shapdes accordingly. the style and structure of a literary text are different from those of the ordinary language because the intentions lying behind them are different and each style is correspondant with the purpose of the  of the writer . Due to the sundry implicationsand connotations words have, translators of literary texts need to find equivalents that are the themost precise  and capable ofconveying the implied meanings. Sincere attempt is needed to transfer cultur-bound idioms and proverbs from SL to TL. L iterary texts are abundant with idioms and proverbs that are meaningful in the context of the culture they are part of. With all such things in mind, a satisfactory literary translation should crave creativity and knowledge on the side of translator if the unity and pleasure of literary texts is to be kept and conveyd.

For this purpose, three persian pieces of poetry by Jalal- addin-Rumi-Avaze Nei(The Reed Flute), Shah va Kanizak (The King and the Servant) , Moosa va Shaban(Moses and the Shepered) will be compared with their english translations. The study draws on the recent version of discourse analysis approach  Baker ,1995 propounding five hypotheses on the specific properties of translation ; namely, simplification, normalization, explicitation, transitivity, and nominalization. The analysis of the data reveals significant cross-linguistic differences in SL and TL as related to these properties, which in turn suggest a shift of mind from mere linguistic  to metalinguistic and ideational analysis of texts in translation process",

Sixteen stories from the second chapter of Gulistan (on the manner of dervishes)were selected and compared whit their translated versions by Arberry(1945), Ross, and Rehatsek(1964) . Cohesive devices, as language specific markers for holding relationship between parts of a text,were first identified and then classified  into gramatical and lexical cohesive ones. Grammatical cohesive devices comprise reference, substitution , ellipsis and conjunction while lexical cohesive devices coprise reiteration and collocation in which reiteration itself includes full repetition synonomy , superordinate and general word. The model followed in the researche was Halliday and Hasan's. The results obtained from the comparison of density of each type of cohesive devices between the original Persian text and the English  versions  reveal somme differences, even among the very  English versions. This suggests lack of one to one textual correspondance between the two genetically the same but typologically different languages, English and Persian, in so far as the base model is concerned.
