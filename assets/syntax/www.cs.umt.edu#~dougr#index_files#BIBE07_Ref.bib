  abstract = {Isolation of translational efficiency bias can have important applications
	in gene expression prediction and heterologous protein production.
	In some genomes the presence of a high {GC(AT)}-content bias can
	confound the isolation of translational efficiency bias. In other
	organisms translational efficiency bias is weak making it difficult
	to isolate. Described here is a multi-objective genetic algorithm
	that improves the isolation of translational efficiency bias in \emph{Streptomyces
	coelicolor A3(2)} and \emph{Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1}, two organisms
	shown to have high {GC}-content and weak translational efficiency
	bias.},
