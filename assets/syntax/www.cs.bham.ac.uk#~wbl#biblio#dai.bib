                 We consider two kinds of knowledge--based protocols:
                 Bayesian and MaxMin behavior. We argue that the ground
                 knowledge type (on which the k--b protocol is based)
                 should be a small part of the whole knowledge. So that
                 we present a transformation of mutual knowledge onto
                 the ground knowledge. The ground knowledge, mutual
                 knowledge and the transformations constitute together
                 knowledge system. We present a simple representation of
                 common knowledge of these systems that gives fast
                 transformation of this knowledge onto actions. This
                 gives rise to a re--interpretation of Agent Oriented
                 Programming paradigm. We postulate that k--b protocol
                 (commitment statements in AOP terms) should be rational
                 (i.e. maximizing the utility) and fixed, whereas the
                 subject of change should be agent's utility and
                 knowledge. If a programmer wants a MAS to reach a goal,
                 he should give to agents such utilities and knowledge
                 that the joint agents' activities maximizing their
                 utilities will lead to a desired state of MAS.",

                 Our research and development activities have focussed
                 on using multi-agent systems to address the
                 inter-organizational aspects of interaction and

                 (CSF), is designed to support distributed

                 extending the CSF to include `agent brokering' between

                 communication in a deliberation phase to adapt a
                 dynamic world. The agent's ability for balancing these
                 factors is very important in the multi-agents world as
                 well as that for balancing deliberation and execution
                 cost in the dynamic world. To realize this ability, we
                 introduce two behavioral parameters, namely, the {\em
                 projection level} and the {\em commitment level}. One
                 controls how far the agent should project in his future
                 based on his current state at the beginning of the
                 planning. The other controls how far the agent should
                 adhere to his plan when he detects change in the world.
                 We show that the agent can control his time cost of
                 planning and communication by changing these levels
                 and, as the result of this, he can make a good plan on
                 that occasion as well as adapt to changes in the

                 have been proposed to deal with Multi-Agent
                 Autoepistemic reasoning. Most of them have some
                 anomalous results while the rest do not have clear and
                 constructive proof theory. For example, Parikh [91]
                 only allows an agent to reason nonmonotonically about
                 other agents' knowledge but not about other agents'
                 nonmonotonic reasoning. Morgenstern [90] provides a
                 limited way to deal with the problem but unfortunately
                 it is not constructive. Although Halpern [94] develops
                 an algorithmetic definition of multiagent nonmonotonic
                 reasoning, his approach cannot deal with default
                 reasoning even for single-agent case. It also does not
                 allow nested nonmonotonic reasoning of an agent about
                 other agents' nonmonotonic reasoning. More important
                 perhaps, these approaches seem to have unintuitive
                 results for multi-agent case and we shall show that by
                 considering some examples from Speech Acts. Our purpose
                 is to find out a simple yet generalised constructive
                 proof-theoretic framework for Multi-Agent Autoepistemic
                 reasoning which retains the advantages of existing
                 approaches but does not have those peculiar results.
                 Surprisingly, the new proof-theoretic framework can be
                 obtained by a simple modification to Parikh's approach.
                 Furthermore, the results show that our framework is not
                 only generalise Morgenstern's and the others approaches
                 but also Niemela's Constructive Tightly Grounded

                 for specifying and analyzing cooperation and conflict
                 resolution protocols among distributed agents. The plan
                 of a single agent, the communication strategy between
                 partners and the actual moves of entities are
                 represented whithin a single framework. The proposed
                 technique relies on modeling agent behaviours and
                 coordinating algorithms by labeled Predicate/Transition
                 Petri nets. Communication primitives are introduced for
                 negotiating shared ressources among distinct partners.
                 In particular, the localization of agents is taken into
                 account for allowing either rendez-vous and
                 simultaneous data exchange, or asynchronous exchanges
                 via message passing. A formal description of

                 of general properties such as deadlock avoidance and
                 guarantee of progress. The introduced model leads to
                 consider conflict and cooperation as two dual

                 protocol for conflict solving. Two-partie and

                 events agents have to deal with. We develop a model for
                 applying Linear Prediction to a Multi-Agent
                 environment. We design a prediction mechanism which
                 senses its environment just by observing plain sampled
                 data. No complex model of the environment has to be
                 built in order to do good predictions of future events.
                 Thus, our agents can react in a real time manner by
                 simply analyzing the observed events. After introducing
                 the theoretical background of Linear Prediction, we
                 show that Linear Prediction can give good results even

                 related to art, entertainment, and user interface.
                 Established fields of art and entertainment (such as
                 film, literature, and theater) depend on believable
                 characters more than intelligent ones. This suggests
                 that there is an opportunity for the AI research
                 community to study a new kind of autonomous agent,
                 where the focus is on believability, not intelligence.
                 I will argue that this opportunity exists, summarize
                 the goals I see for believable agents researchs, and
                 try to explain the key differences between
                 believability and traditional scientific goals such as
                 intelligence and realism. I will conclude with the

                 the domain of traffic signal control whose usual
                 strategies are modelled in a decentralized fashion. In
                 our architecture traffic elements are modelled as
                 single agents which have diverse knowledge represented
                 by means of information sets. Lack of knowledge is
                 modelled by means of games with incomplete information.
                 Interactions among agents are both cooperative and
                 noncooperative and are based on the rationality of the
                 agents, which pick one of the equilibrium points of the
                 game. Therefore the problem of equilibrium selection
                 for noncooperative games is explored. For cooperative
                 games the bargaining solution is used. Some examples of
                 the traffic signal control domain which map
                 interactions in noncooperative as well as in

                 this problem leads to a space of design tasks with a
                 default order defined by the problem domain. Any one of
                 these tasks can be the current task of the designer and
                 is subject to influence from a case. The case is
                 decomposed to extract a sequence of tasks to aid the
                 designer in solving the current task, as well as
                 geometric and relational information about the objects
                 which make up the case. Each of these tasks in the case
                 is instantiated into a computational agent, with a
                 behavioral and a domain knowledge component. The
                 behavioral component consists of a set of generic
                 spatial actions, organised in layers. The domain
                 component consists of knowledge needs for the layout of
                 supply-air pipes. A generic control system is defined
                 both for the interaction between the behavioral and
                 domain component of the agent, as well as interaction
                 between groups of agents. An interactive application of
                 the designer, information from the case and agents then
                 drives the problem to an intended solution. A scenario

                 support the migration of agents between societies that
                 have different communication mechanisms, that is,
                 dealing with the problem of an agent entering any
                 existing society whose communication means are unknown.
                 We think that such features will become increasingly
                 important in the account of complex, heterogeneous,
                 adaptive, evolutionary, continuously running, open
                 systems. We give intuitive ideas concerning the
                 architecture of multi-agent systems where this
                 phenomenon may occur. We propose that agents able to
                 migrate must interpret a universal meta-language that
                 can express in a formal way the syntax and semantics of
                 the languages for protocol description and execution
                 used in the target societies. We also propose that the
                 arriving agents must have access to some minimum
                 meta-protocols allowing them to perform minimal
                 interactions leading to the learning of the protocols
                 used in each society. Some implementation issues and
                 future applications are discussed.",

                 efficient strategy to handle their encounters with

                 optimal interactive strategy is a hard problem because
                 it depends mostly on the behavior of the others. In
                 this work, interaction among agents is represented as a
                 repeated two-player game, where an agents' objective is
                 to look for a strategy that maximizes their expected
                 sum of rewards in the game. We assume that agents'
                 strategies can be modeled as finite automata. A {\em
                 model based reasoning} approach is presented as a
                 possible method for learning an efficient interactive
                 strategy. First, we describe how an agent should find
                 an optimal strategy against a given model. Second, we
                 present a heuristic algorithm that infers a model of
                 the opponent's automata from its input/output behavior.
                 A set of experiments that show the potential merit of
                 the algorithm is reported as well.",

                 issues that have arisen in modeling the beliefs of

                 Commitment as a descriptive ontology crucial for the
                 understanding of groups' and organizations'
                 functioning, and of the relations between individual
                 agents and collective activity. Some of the basic
                 ingredients of such notions are identified and some
                 steps are made towards their definition. In particular,
                 it is claimed that a notion of Commitment is needed as
                 a mediation between the individual and the collective
                 one. Before constructing a notion of {"}Collective or
                 Group Commitment{"} a notion of {"}Social Commitment{"}
                 is to be defined. {"}Social commitment{"} is not an
                 individual Commitment shared by many agents; it is the
                 Commitment of one agent to another. The normative
                 contents (entitlements / obligations) of this social
                 relation are stressed and its connections with
                 individual intentions and collective activity. On that
                 basis, a notion of Organizational Commitment is
                 proposed, that could account for the structure of
                 stable Organizations. Commitment is a crucial notion
                 both to analyse the structure of Organizations and to
                 support cooperative work, but a deeper analysis is
                 needed, connecting agent's mental states with social
                 relations and structure.",

                 into a single location starting from distributed
                 arrangements. An efficient solution is one in which all
                 agents work simultaneously, and in which the meeting
                 location determines adaptively. However, the difficulty
                 with this solution is that the agents, and hence the
                 meeting location, will move unpredictably. We evaluate
                 a dynamic solution that uses the trailblazer search as
                 the search strategy of agents. Considering the tradeoff
                 between reaction time and number of moves, the
                 trailblazer search is an algorithm that dynamically
                 maintains a map of where an agent has already searched
                 through in the problem space (Chimura & Tokoro 94).
                 Through a simple simulation we show the effect of
                 agents maintaining maps, hence show that mapping
                 functions can facilitate cooperation in meeting

                 revisions. Elaboration tolerance is a vital property
                 for building situated agents: it allows for adapting
                 and re-using a previous problem representation in
                 different (but related) situations, rather than
                 building a new representation from scratch. We

                 communication language KQML. By using this language for
                 communication, agents will be able to request and
                 deliver services to one another. Indeed, numerous
                 projects have shown how the language can profitably
                 support interoperation among distributed agents.
                 However, before becoming a widely-accepted standard, it
                 would be worthwhile to examine the language in detail.
                 This paper explores semantical issues raised by KQML,
                 specifically the use of performatives for interagent
                 communication. Numerous difficulties with the language
                 are identified, and an attempt is made to point to
                 their resolution. The paper illustrates the kind of
                 semantics we believe to be necessary to characterize
                 agent communication languages, and applies it to
                 compose a question from a request and an inform.
                 Finally, the paper discusses possible impacts to be
                 felt on various KQML decisions from the semantical
                 issues raised here.",

                 for negotiation among a group of peers and is also
                 applicable to a manager that must balance conflicting
                 views of its workers. The distributed scheduling
                 algorithm that is used selects a candidate >from the
                 priority list of resource requests and inserts that
                 candidate into the evolving timetable. Two protocols
                 are required. The minimax protocol assures equitable
                 power among the peers. The bumping protocol allows
                 reactive scheduling by using a request's total worth to
                 dictate when a new request can seize a previously
                 assigned resource. A request's total worth is the sum
                 of its priority value, its ordering value, and any
                 bonus points received by previous negotiations. Three
                 styles of negotiation are examined: unilateral,
                 verbose, and periodic. Results from sample scenarios
                 are also presented.",

  abstract =     "Many researchers have shown that there is no single
                 best organization or coordination mechanism for all
                 environments. This paper discusses the design and
                 implementation of an extendable family of coordination
                 mechanisms, called Generalized Partial Global Planning
                 (GPGP). The set of coordination mechanisms described
                 here assists in scheduling activities for teams of
                 cooperative computational agents. The GPGP approach has
                 several unique features. First, it is not tied to a
                 single domain. Each mechanism is defined as a response
                 to certain features in the current task environment. We
                 show that different combinations of mechanisms are
                 appropriate for different task environments. Secondly,
                 the approach works in conjunction with an agent's
                 existing local planner/scheduler. Finally, the initial
                 set of five mechanisms presented here generalizes and
                 extends the Partial Global Planning (PGP) algorithm. In
                 comparison to PGP, GPGP allows more agent
                 heterogeneity, it exchanges less global information,
                 and it communicates at multiple levels of
                 abstraction.",

                 several agents to cooperate in finding a solution.
                 Systems based on our teamwork method use four types of
                 agents: Experts and specialists use heuristics to
                 generate results that are possible parts of solutions,
                 referees judge the experts and their results
                 determining the most promising ones and a supervisor
                 collects these promising results to generate new
                 problem descriptions that converge to a solution of the
                 initial problem. The main difficulty of distributed
                 systems, the communication overhead, is dealt with by
                 restricting the work of referees and the supervisor to
                 short moments, called team meetings, that interrupt the
                 work of experts and specialists. The competition and
                 cooperation of experts and specialists in this
                 framework allow for synergetic effects that generate
                 better and faster solutions to the search problems. We
                 demonstrate these effects for instantiations of two
                 very different kinds of search problems, automated
                 theorem proving and optimization problems.",

                 and opportunities of agents are formalized as well as
                 the results of actions they perform. To cope with a
                 complexity of a rational agent behaviour, we consider
                 scenarios composed of traditionally viewed basic
                 actions and atomic actions with typical effects. We

                 a {"}typical{"} pattern of an agent's behaviour.

                 nonmonotonic preferential strategy for these scenarios

                 over cooperating agents. To this end, we use a theory
                 for the treatment of problems arising as a decision
                 making agent faces a situation involving a choice
                 between a finite set of strategies, having access to a
                 finite set of autonomous agents reporting their
                 opinions. The decision making agent is allowed to
                 assign different credibility to statements of the
                 autonomous agents. The theory admits the representation
                 of vague and numerically imprecise information, and the
                 evaluation results in a set of admissible strategies,
                 by using criteria conforming to classical statistical
                 theory. The admissible strategies can be further
                 investigated with respect to their strengths and also
                 with respect to the range of values consistent with the

                 Artificial Intelligence. Much work in this field can be
                 seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with
                 differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their
                 actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one
                 cornerstone assumption of the field is that
                 communication is expensive relative to local
                 computation. Thus, coordination techniques that
                 minimize communication are of particular importance.
                 This paper considers how automated agents could use a
                 coordination technique common to communication-free
                 human interactions, namely {\em focal points}. Given a
                 problem and a set of possible solutions from which the
                 agents need to choose one, focal points are prominent
                 solutions of the problem to which agents are drawn.
                 Theoretical work on this subject
                 includes~\cite{schelling63,kraus91a}. The purpose of
                 the current research is to consider the practical use
                 of focal point techniques in various domains. We
                 present simulations over randomly generated domains;
                 these simulations strongly suggest that focal points
                 can act as an effective heuristic for coordination in
                 real-world environments.",

                 probability for an individual to survive. These methods
                 give rise to conflicts due to limited resource access
                 and lack of coordination. Specific methods such as task
                 allocation, communication, action coordination and
                 conflict resolution can be used to solve these problems
                 and contribute to an expansion of the capabilities of
                 the group. Organizations, i.e. set of structured
                 societies of individuals, emerge from them. This talk

                 scheduling within a society of shipping companies as a
                 multiagent system. Emphasis is placed on the
                 functionality of the system as a whole --- the solution
                 of the global scheduling problem emerges from local
                 decision-making and problem-solving strategies. An
                 extension of the contract net protocol is presented; we
                 show that it can be used to obtain good initial
                 solutions for complex resource allocation problems. By
                 introducing global information based upon auction
                 protocols, this initial solution can be improved
                 significantly. Experimental results are provided
                 evaluating the performance of different cooperative
                 scheduling strategies. Although the concepts for
                 resource scheduling are presented solely for the
                 transportation domain, their abstraction is useful for
                 a broad variety of resource allocation problems. The
                 MARS system solves the dynamic scheduling problem where
                 no complete specification of the problem is available a
                 priori; thus, it is designed as an on-line system based

                 InteRRaP is a pragmatic approach to designing complex
                 dynamic agent societies, e.g. for robotics and
                 cooperative scheduling applications. It is based on
                 three general functions describing how the actions an
                 agent commits to are derived from its perception and
                 from its mental model: {\em belief revision and
                 abstraction}, {\em situation recognition and goal
                 activation}, and {\em planning and scheduling}. It is

                 intentions to other components of the mental state of
                 an agent, has been a topic of active research. However,
                 when we look for foundations on which to base
                 implementations of agencies, we get in real trouble
                 because the formal side is too far from the engineering
                 side. In this paper, we defend a model of goals and
                 intentions, based on deductive structures, and an
                 integrated framework for revising them, that can and
                 has been adopted as a specification for designing and
                 building up artificial agents. The development of our
                 model has guided the parallel development of a
                 workbench, and experimentation with earlier versions of
                 the workbench has in turn provided guidance for the
                 refinement and extension of the conceptual model. We
                 argue that research for theoretical foundations of
                 multiagent systems must open the way for such walks,
                 forth towards implementations and back, in order to
                 lead up to realistic models.",

                 environment. This framework formalizes and composes two
                 basic ideas. The first is that of {\it reasoner}, where
                 a reasoner is an extensional representation of an
                 agent's beliefs or of a view of an agent's beliefs. The
                 second is that of {\it observer} i.e. of reasoner
                 having beliefs about another reasoner. Reasoners and
                 observers can be uniformly represented and composed in
                 {\it belief systems} to describe complex multiagent
                 scenarios. Belief systems are naturally presented using
                 {\it Multi context systems}. We show how some of the
                 modal approaches to the formalization of (non)
                 omniscient belief can be captured within our

                 the foundation for computational societies of software
                 agents. Already, these new societies have encountered
                 problems endemic to human communities, such as
                 overusing common resources with thrashing over virtual
                 memory and competition by packets for network time.
                 Unlike with human societies, these inefficiencies can
                 be overcome by re-working the algorithms governing the
                 protocols. However, the public good problem, in which a
                 common good is available to all regardless of
                 contribution, can arise computationally in more subtle
                 ways. We discuss how this can happen using Braess'
                 Paradox and demonstrate that adding resources to a
                 computational system can counterintuitively lower the
                 overall performance. This is thus a case in which
                 distributed algorithms are provably unable to achieve
                 globally optimal performance. We illustrate our claim

                 Method, which we have previously, somewhat informally,

                 can use for intelligent coordination and communication
                 with other agents. Our formalism is closely related to
                 models proposed in the area of game theory, but
                 contains new elements that lead to a different solution
                 concept. The advantage of our solution method is that
                 always yields the optimal solution, which is the
                 rational action of the agent in a multi-agent
                 environment, given the agent's state of knowledge and
                 its preferences, and that it works in realistic cases
                 when agents have only a finite amount of information
                 about the agents they interact with. Our framework can
                 be used to investigate the rational communicative
                 behavior. We define the concept of a pragmatic meaning
                 of a speech act, and show how to use it to evaluate the
                 expected utility of performing such a speech act. The
                 expected utility can be used to choose the optimal
                 communicative behavior.",

                 improve their performance. Agents, in meeting with
                 others, can learn about the partner's knowledge and
                 strategic behavior. Agents that operate in dynamic
                 environments could react to unexpected events by
                 generalizing what they have learned during a training
                 stage. In this paper, we propose several learning rules
                 for agents in a multiagent environment. Each agent acts
                 as the teacher of its partner. The agents are trained
                 by receiving examples from a sample space; they then go
                 through a generalization step during which they have to
                 apply the concept they have learned from their
                 instructor. Agents that learn from each other can
                 sometimes avoid repeatedly coordinating their actions
                 from scratch for similar problems. They will sometimes
                 be able to avoid communication at run-time, by using

                 allows distributed agents to learn multiple
                 interrelated tasks in a real-time environment. DRLM
                 consists of a hidden task model (HTM) used for dealing
                 with incomplete perception, a composite state model
                 (CSM) for interdependency between tasks, and a Q-
                 learing subsystem (QLS) for updating action merit. In
                 this paper, we also present a distributed Q-learning
                 algorithm and an architecture that allows agents to
                 reward their peers' actions and share their experience.
                 DRLM is successfully implemented in a flexible
                 manufactuing system where sensors (modeled as agents)
                 have to learn to communicate with humans about the

                 order to analyze the dynamic properties of the CNP. We
                 have obtained the following results: the contractor
                 utility increases together with the system load while
                 the manager utility decreases; when the number of
                 agents increases, the contractor utility rises while
                 the manager utility does not change; the uniformity of
                 agents causes the concentration of ``bids'' and
                 ``awards,'' and thus decreases the manager and the
                 contractor utility. Furthermore, we apply our
                 simulation results to analyze Enterprise, a famous
                 application of the CNP, and point out the problem which
                 might arise in Enterprise.",

                 processes that guide communicative actions of agents
                 towards a potential cooperation. For this purpose we
                 develop a formal theory with an internal perspective,
                 which enables us to identify the key data structures
                 and specify the relationships between them. The
                 reasoning processes are described in terms of beliefs,
                 desires and intentions of individual agents. The
                 logical model of these attitudes are used to formally
                 define a number of important states including agent to
                 agent commitment. The reasoning processes are in
                 essence the transitions through these states, specified
                 by a set of rules as part of our specification
                 language. As a result of these processes, an agent may
                 adopt goals to communicate. These goals are fed back
                 into the reasoning process to find appropriate
                 communication plans that fulfill them. Our approach is
                 therefore pragmatic since it enables a direct coupling
                 of our theoretical concepts to an implementable
                 model.",

                 only the sender of a message intends to communicate,
                 but also the receiver is normally motivated to know the
                 semantic content of the message intended by the sender,
                 even if the receiver doubts the sender's honesty. The
                 present paper accounts for how autonomous agents as
                 selfish utility maximizers naturally cooperate in
                 reaching a common optimal mapping between messages and
                 their contents, raising the robustness of
                 communication. An occasion of communication between two
                 agents can be generally formalized as a non-cooperative
                 n-person game (usually n>2), and the optimal mapping is
                 shown to be obtained as a Nash equilibrium which
                 maximizes the agents' expected utility over all the
                 possible occasions of communication. Some regularities
                 in natural language pragmatics are demonstrated to

                 improvise a course of behavior that follows the

                 of cooperation strategies for a group of problem
                 solvers based on the Genetic Programming (GP) paradigm.
                 GP's are a class of adaptive algorithms used to evolve
                 solution structures that optimize a given evaluation
                 criterion. Our approach is based on designing a
                 representation for cooperation strategies that can be
                 manipulated by GPs. We present results from experiments
                 in the predator-prey domain, which has been extensively
                 studied as an easy-to-describe but difficult-to-solve
                 cooperation problem domain. They key aspect of our
                 approach is the minimal reliance on domain knowledge
                 and human intervention in the construction of good
                 cooperation strategies. Promising comparison results

                 they interact with each other, it is helpful to form a
                 coalition, which is a group of agents working together.
                 Previous approach to coalition formation suggests to
                 define the utility of coalitions and to use a strategy
                 that agents form coalitions for getting higher utility.
                 However, in some problems, the utility of coalitions is
                 not easily obtainable because it might depend on
                 uncertainty of other agents' problem solving. We
                 describe a model of coalition formation where agents
                 form coalitions for breaking deadlocks. In this model,

                 agents. Preliminary research has demonstrated that the
                 plan recognition system developed makes coordination of
                 multiple agents possible. An important issue that
                 arises when observation is the primary means of
                 information acquisition is the introduction of
                 uncertainty into the coordination process. We have
                 explored the issue of early versus late commitment to
                 the uncertain information thus gained and the resulting
                 tradeoff between time and effort as the commitment
                 level is changed. Our results show that while in some
                 situations it is worthwhile delaying commitment until
                 uncertainty is reduced, in other situations it is
                 important to act even when uncertainty is high. The
                 long--term goal of the research is to develop the
                 notion of coordination through observation, where
                 agents utilize plan recognition to acquire coordination

                 agents representing individual temperature controllers

                 and no agent sells resources for less than its bid. The

                 marketplace is the ease with which applications can be
                 developed. One approach is to use general purpose
                 languages to construct layers of agent level
                 constructs. Object-oriented languages have been
                 advocated as suitable for tackling the complexity of
                 distributed systems. According to Gasser and Briot
                 [1992], the key problem with the common forms of object
                 based concurrent programming is the fixed boundaries
                 they give to agents are too inflexible. They do not

                 DAI or the reality of multilevel aggregations of
                 actions and knowledge. This paper advocates the use of
                 a rather different type of object based concurrent
                 language, stream logic programming (SLP) that does not
                 have this drawback.",

                 (RTBS) algorithms, where two problem solving agents,
                 starting from the initial and goal states, physically
                 move toward each other. To evaluate the RTBS
                 performance, two kinds of algorithms are proposed and
                 are compared to real-time unidirectional search (RTUS).
                 One is called centralized RTBS where a supervisor
                 always selects the best action from all possible moves
                 of the two problem solvers. The other is called
                 decoupled RTBS where no supervisor exists and the two
                 problem solvers independently select their next moves.
                 Experiments on mazes and n-puzzles show that (1) in
                 clear situations decoupled RTBS performs better, while
                 in uncertain situations, centralized RTBS becomes more
                 efficient, and that (2) RTBS is more efficient than
                 RTUS for 15- and 24-puzzles but not for randomly
                 generated mazes. It will be shown that the selection of
                 the multi-agent organization is the selection of the
                 problem space, which determines the baseline of the
                 organizational efficiency; once a hard problem space is
                 selected, the local coordination among problem solvers
                 cannot overcome the deficit.",

                 are essential in this algorithm: 1) the observability

                 general and diagnostic domains in particular. These
                 generic tasks and methods are defined within five
                 phases (preprocessing, decomposition, control,
                 decision, and postprocessing) of a Generic Integrated
                 Information Processing Architecture symbolic and
                 sub-symbolic (connectionist) systems. The information
                 processing architecture has been based on pragmatic
                 issues like real time, conscious and
                 unconscious/automated behavior, learning, reliability,
                 generalization, incorrect/incomplete information and
                 others. Secondly, based on task, method and phase
                 abstraction of the information processing architecture,
                 a distributed heterogenous computational architecture
                 of symbolic and sub-symbolic agents is developed.
                 Issues associated with computational architecture like
                 communication, parallelism, learning, and others are
                 then discussed. The architecture has been applied in
                 building a real time alrm processing system in a power
                 system control centre with encouraging performance
                 results. About 60 rules and 20 artificial neural

                 therefore error-prone. Especially the fact that there
                 is a lot of interaction between agents can cause
                 serious errors. In this paper we present an agent
                 algebra which allows the formal description of MAS but
                 also the verification of properties (safety and
                 progress properties) of MAS. This can help the designer
                 to become clear about the design and the correctness of
                 the implementation. Our agent algebra can thus aid in
                 making MAS suitable for control of safety critical
                 systems such as flight control. Our agent algebra,
                 whose terms, structured operational semantics and laws
                 are described in this paper, focuses on interaction of
                 agents. Thus, our agent algebra is especially suited
                 for the description of cooperation and conflict (which
                 is a major concern in MAS) among agents.",

                 interdatabase dependencies (IDD) using a federative
                 agent system FCSI is presented. The architecture of the
                 FCSI is designed as a system of cooperative intelligent
                 autonomous agents each of them uniquely assigned to one
                 local database system. The {\em FCSI aims for a
                 cooperative solution for the problem of finding
                 semantically related information while strictly
                 respecting the autonomy requirements of each individual
                 database system.} For this purpose first a {\em
                 descriptive, terminological meta-knowledge and domain
                 information representation {\sf DIT} on top of the
                 local conceptual database schema} is built at each
                 agent by using user-specified {\em intentional
                 scripts}. In addition, a respectively instantiated
                 actual aspect world {\sf W} enables a more flexible
                 representation of {\em schema object aspects}.
                 According to a prior known set of common terminological
                 primitives {\sf cpc} of respective local {\sf DIT}s
                 remote {\em terminological classification} then serves
                 as a basis for the {\em discovery of intentional IDD}s
                 ({\sf i-IDD}) between objects of different schemas with
                 respect to some or all of their sofar related
                 intentional interpretation aspects. Projections on
                 respective associated {\em aspect valuations at schema
                 and state level} {\sf isp}s determine {\em
                 context-based data sharing} and result in restricted
                 proposals for {\em interdatabase schema assertions}
                 ({\sf IDSA}).\\ In order to organize a {\em cooperative
                 recognition process} of {\sf i-IDD}s between the
                 autonomous FCSI agents a method for decentralized {\em

                 complex problem solving is the maximisation of the
                 quality of the result to be obtained at minimum cost.
                 Both the general granularity of the agent society and
                 the competence assigned to each individual agent
                 determine the information flow in the network. The
                 great number of parameters involved make it difficult
                 for the designer to optimally adapt the structure of
                 the network to a given class of tasks. In this paper we
                 outline possible network structures and present an
                 approach for determining a number of important
                 statistical parameters characterising the network at a
                 relatively abstract level. The abstraction enables a
                 comparison of different network structures. The methods
                 for the analysis may, however, be readily refined to
                 evaluate a specific problem. As an example we discuss
                 the use of the multi-agent paradigm for structuring the
                 cooperation of sensor networks in robotics. Our
                 analysis is supple-mented by simulation results, which
                 prove a superiority of lateral over pure hierarchical
                 coordination, particularly under severe environmental
                 conditions, such as agent failure.",

                 agents using only very local information, and not by
                 their complex and globally coordinated actions which
                 would use global message passing and high level
                 strategies. The fundamental factors for establishing
                 the global order by self-organization are ``dissipative
                 structure'' and ``self-catalysis mechanism.'' If an
                 environment where agents exist has a dissipative
                 structure and those agents have some sort of
                 self-catalysis mechanisms within themselves, it is

                 simple and locally coordinated actions. ``The

  abstract =     "This paper presents a language called AgenTalk for
                 describing coordination protocols for multiagent
                 systems. Many coordination protocols such as the
                 contract net protocol have been proposed, and many
                 application-specific coordination protocols are
                 expected to be required soon as more software agents
                 start to be built. However, no general framework has
                 yet been proposed for defining and implementing such
                 coordination protocols. AgenTalk is designed to solve
                 this problem; it allows coordination protocols to be
                 defined incrementally and to be easily customized to
                 suit application domains by incorporating an
                 inheritance mechanism. This paper describes the design
                 policies of AgenTalk and demonstrates its capability by
                 describing the contract net protocol and the multistage
                 negotiation protocol in AgenTalk utilizing its
                 inheritance mechanism. A comparison is made with KQML
                 (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language), and the
                 relationships with related research in distributed
                 artificial intelligence are discussed.",

                 and developed techniques for intelligently sharing
                 resources --- specifically, communication channels ---
                 among agents in multiagent systems. Our techniques
                 allow agents to nearly optimize their communication
                 behavior in a self-organizing and distributed fashion,
                 involving the use of a microeconomic pricing system
                 based on economic laws of supply and demand and trading
                 among agents in real-time. Our analyses are based on
                 three measures of performance: fairness of resource
                 allocation, waiting time for resources, and utilization
                 of resources. Our initial analysis indicates that
                 fairness and utilization are conflicting, in that the
                 best utilization with a fair allocation is equivalent
                 to the worst utilization with an unfair resource
                 allocation, assuming the allocation policy is
                 statically defined. To strike a balance in performance,
                 we have developed mechanisms that establish an
                 artificial economy, where agents can dynamically
                 reallocate goods (resource access) using a competitive
                 market pricing mechanism. However, unlike more common
                 market-oriented methods, our approach does not demand
                 convergence to equilibrium, but permits more rapid,
                 heuristic trading, leading to near optimal performance
                 where both buyers and sellers of resources can benefit.
                 Our studies show that agents employing our mechanisms
                 can dramatically improve utilization while still
                 providing ``fair'' access to the resources.",

  abstract =     "Distributed constraint optimization imposes
                 considerable complexity in agents' coordinated search
                 for an optimal solution. However, in many application
                 domains, problems often exhibit special structures that
                 can be exploited to facilitate more efficient problem
                 solving. One of the most recurrent structures involves
                 disparity among subproblems. We present a coordination
                 mechanism, Anchor&Ascend, for distributed constraint
                 optimization that takes advantage of disparity among
                 subproblems to efficiently guide distributed local
                 search for global optimality. The coordination
                 mechanism assigns different overlapping subproblems to
                 agents who must interact and iteratively converge on a
                 solution. In particular, an anchor agent who conducts
                 local best first search to optimize its subsolution
                 interacts with the rest of the agents who perform
                 distributed constraint satisfaction to enforce problem
                 constraints and constraints imposed by the anchor
                 agent. We focus our study on the well-known NP-complete
                 job shop scheduling problem. We define and study two
                 problem structure measures, disparity ratio and
                 disparity composition ratio. We experimentally
                 evaluated the effectiveness of the Anchor&Ascend
                 mechanism on a suite of job shop scheduling problems
                 over a wide range of values of disparity composition.
                 Our experimental results show that (1) considerable
                 advantage can be obtained by explicitly exploiting
                 disparity (2) disparity composition ratio plays a more
                 important role than disparity ratio in finding high
                 quality solution with little computational cost.",

                 difficulty concerning basic terms and concepts. In

                 different connotations. In this paper we lay the
                 foundations for a principled theory of agency and
                 autonomy, and specify the relationship between them.
                 Using the Z specification language, we decribe a
                 three-tiered hierarchy comprising objects, agents and
                 autonomous agents where agents are viewed as objects
                 with goals, and autonomous agents are agents with

                 cooperation among agents. This paper presents a

                 loop of goal activation, plan execution and scheduling
                 followed by task execution. This allows for a
                 presentation of the semantics of cooperation
                 primitives: interagent messages supporting cooperation,
                 comprised of speech acts operating upon objects
                 occuring in the basic loop. The formal semantics of
                 cooperation primitives gives a meaning to indiviudal
                 messages, independent from the cooperation protocol.
                 Thus, agents can reason about exchanged messages and
                 are able to dynamically create their own methods for

                 whose description is not known a priori. In our
                 approach the environment is described, from a symbolic
                 point of view, by means of a graph; clustering
                 techniques allow for further levels of abstraction to
                 be defined, leading to a multi-layered representation.
                 In this work we propose an unsupervised exploration
                 algorithm in which several agents cooperate to acquire
                 knowledge of the environment at the different
                 abstraction levels; a broadcast model is adopted for
                 inter-agent communication. All agents are structurally
                 equal and pursue the same local exploration strategy;
                 nevertheless, the existence of multiple levels of
                 abstraction in the environment representation allows
                 for the agents' behaviours to differentiate. Agents
                 carry out exploration at different abstraction levels,
                 aimed at reproducing an ideal exploration profile; each

                 proposed. The major implication of this framework is
                 that for systems embedded in a dynamic environment an
                 approach based on highly autonomous and siutated agents
                 is called for. In the main part of the paper, an
                 architecture and a design process of complex agents are
                 proposed. This is illustrated with a coaching
                 application. In our architecture, a complex agent
                 consists of a {"}society{"} of agents which are
                 designed in an incremental, bottom-up manner according
                 to what we call a behavioural engineering approach. The
                 agents operate in parallel and have a close coupling
                 between perception and action. Emergent functionality
                 and memory-based learning characterize the adaptive
                 behaviour of the agents. Furture research will focus on
                 additional learning processes for the agents and will
                 explore the concept of plans as a resource for situated
                 action.",

                 might increase their utility by behaving optimally
                 given the strategies of the other agents. To do so,
                 agents need to learn about those with whom they share
                 the same world. This paper examines interactions among
                 agents from a game theoretic perspective. In this
                 context, learning has been assumed as a means to reach
                 equilibrium. We analyze the complexity of this learning
                 process. We start with a restricted two--agent model,
                 in which agents are represented by finite automata, and
                 one of the agents plays a fixed strategy. We show that
                 even with this restrictions, the learning process may
                 be exponential in time. We then suggest a criterion of
                 simplicity, that induces a class of automata that are
                 learnable in polynomial time.",

                 finite length of time. We show that a minimal bound on

                 enable cooperative behavior. In addition, a variant of
                 the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game is suggested, in
                 which players have the choice of opting out. This

                 of cooperative strategies. Competitive analysis is
                 suggested as a tool for investigating sub-optimal (but

                 theoretic models in general. Using competitive

                 great variety of potentially valuable information
                 services. However, neither network capabilities nor
                 users' time and money are infinite. Computational
                 markets provide one type of mechanism for allocating
                 limited resources in such an environment in a
                 distributed, dynamic way. Moreover, the underlying
                 economic theory provides an analytical framework for
                 predicting aggregate behavior and designing individual
                 agents. In this paper, we describe a prototypical
                 computational market model for information services

                 economic problem of when and where to establish mirror

                 Competitive agents choose to set up mirrors based on
                 going prices for network bandwidth, computational
                 resources, and the information service. Depending on

                 units. We named the methodology ``organic programming''

                 strategy to implement an adaptive organization for
                 reactive cooperative planning. The adaptive
                 organization changes its organizational scheme
                 adaptively as a means of coping with the dynamic
                 problem spaces. Preliminary experiments shows that an
                 adaptive organization can be made to the increase
                 efficiency in dynamic problem spaces. The reason for
                 this works is that reducing the degree of freedom in
                 the problem space, while increasing the degree of
                 interaction, demands greater coordination. However, if
                 the number of effective local plans decrease, it would
                 seem likely that if the agents were to have a better
                 metalevel strategy, they would be better able to search
                 this reduced space efficiently. The metalevel
                 coordination incorporates an agent-wide metalevel
                 heuristic function. In designing the metalevel
                 coordination strategy, we take three aspects of
                 reactive cooperative planning into account. These
                 aspects include: the difference in the degree of
                 achievement in successive turns; the certainty of
                 shared information; and the degree of freedom of choice
                 for agent's behavior. The adaptive organization works
                 efficiently in cases where the communication cost is
                 relatively expensive.",

                 developed to investigate strategies for teams in a
                 competitive environment, and discusses some of the
                 issues surrounding the evolution of cooperation among
                 team members. As its title suggests, Coach is a
                 simulator of sporting environments, as these possess
                 the required motivations for such behaviour and have
                 the potential to benefit the real sporting world. In
                 addition to describing Coach, this paper describes two
                 applications illustrating the potential and value of
                 the system. It examines cooperation within a simplified
                 model of the game of volleyball in which cooperation
                 emerged in the form of players passing the ball between
                 them in order to control it for an effective offensive
                 hit. Each player learnt a specialized skill which, in
                 close harmony with the other team member's skills,
                 provided the team with a strategy not unlike those used
                 by real volleyball players. Some preliminary
                 experiments were also carried out to investigate

                 capable of rational behaviour has received a great deal

                 formalizations of such agents and their implementations
                 have proceeded in parallel with little or no connection
                 between them. This paper explores a particular type of
                 rational agent, a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent.
                 The primary aim of this paper is to integrate (a) the
                 theoretical foundations of BDI agents from both a
                 quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a
                 symbolic reasoning perspective; (b) the implementations
                 of BDI agents >from an ideal theoretical perspective
                 and a more practical perspective; and (c) the building
                 of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. In
                 particular, an air-traffic management application will
                 be analyzed from both a theoretical and an

                 unaddressed issues that arise in automated negotiation
                 among self-interested agents whose rationality is
                 bounded by computational complexity. These issues are
                 presented in the context of iterative task allocation
                 negotiations. First, the reasons why such agents need
                 to be able to choose the stage and level of commitment
                 dynamically are identified. A protocol that allows such
                 choices through conditional commitment breaking
                 penalties is presented. Next, the implications of
                 bounded rationality are analyzed. Several tradeoffs
                 between allocated computation and negotiation benefits
                 and risk are enumerated, and the necessity of explicit
                 local deliberation control is substantiated. Techniques
                 for linking negotiation items and multiagent contracts
                 are presented as methods for escaping local optima in
                 the task allocation process. Implementing both methods
                 among self-interested bounded rational agents is
                 discussed. Finally, the problem of message congestion
                 among self-interested agents is described, and
                 alternative remedies are presented.",

  abstract =     "Q-learning is a recent reinforcement learning (RL)
                 algorithm that does not need a model of its environment
                 and can be used on-line. Therefore it is well-suited
                 for use in repeated games against an unknown opponent.
                 Most RL research has been confined to single agent
                 settings or to multiagent settings where the agents
                 have totally positively correlated payoffs (team
                 problems) or totally negatively correlated payoffs
                 (zero-sum games). This paper is an empirical study of
                 reinforcement learning in the iterated prisoner's
                 dilemma (IPD), where the agents' payoffs are neither
                 totally positively nor totally negatively correlated.
                 RL is considerably more difficult in such a domain.
                 This paper investigates the ability of a variety of
                 Q-learning agents to play the IPD game against an
                 unknown opponent. In some experiments, the opponent is
                 the fixed strategy Tit-for-Tat, while in others it is
                 another Q-learner. All the Q-learners learned to play
                 optimally against Tit-for-Tat. Playing against another
                 learner was more difficult because the adaptation of
                 the other learner creates a nonstationary environment
                 in ways that are detailed in the paper. The learners
                 that were studied varied along three dimensions: the
                 length of history they received as context, the type of
                 memory they employed (lookup tables based on restricted
                 history windows or recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
                 that can theoretically store features from arbitrarily
                 deep in the past), and the exploration schedule they
                 followed. Although all the learners faced difficulties
                 when playing against other learners, agents with longer
                 history windows, lookup table memories, and longer
                 exploration schedules fared best in the IPD games.",

                 coordination or explicit communication. We first define

                 system efficiency. We then investigate the properties
                 of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous

                 the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that

                 is the tradeoff between local autonomy and global
                 performance. If agents can be assumed to be working
                 towards a common goal or to be cooperative in nature,
                 significant overall performance improvements can be
                 obtained over selfish and uncooperative agents. In a
                 distributed and open system, assumptions about a
                 system-wide common goal or about the philanthropic
                 nature of agents are unrealistic. We provide a simple
                 behavioral rule based on reciprocity that allows
                 autonomous agents to effectively share workload with
                 others. We use a package delivery domain to demonstrate
                 how reciprocal behavior can allow agents to produce
                 desirable global performance without sacrificing
                 individual autonomy or efficiency. More interestingly,
                 we show that agents who do not help others are less
                 efficient with this mechanism than agents who share
                 workloads with others. As a result, the best
                 self-motivated actions lead to system-wide
                 cooperation.",

                 tools. The individuals or the individual groups of the

                 fundamental concepts of a social reasoning mechanism,
                 which enables an agent to reason about the others using
                 information about their goals, actions, resources and
                 plans. In this paper we first place ourselves as an
                 external observer to analyse the possible coupled
                 outcomes of the social reasoning mechanisms of two
                 different agents. We show that in some particular
                 cases, different inferred dependence situations imply
                 that the agents' mutual representations are
                 inconsistent at an agency level. Then, we detail our
                 analysis in a particular case where the agents have the
                 same plans (and believe in that), showing that some
                 particular coupled outcomes can be explained either by
                 incorrectness or incompleteness of mutual
                 representation. In order to do that, we extend our
                 previous model by introducing the notion of goal
                 situation. Finally, we conclude by showing that these
                 properties may be detected by the agents themselves if
                 we supply them with an internal mechanism where they
                 can manipulate the outcomes inferred both by their own

                 coordination strategies are not always cost-effective
                 in all problem-solving situations. This paper presents
                 a learning method to acquire coordination plans for
                 specific problem-solving situations so that the
                 appropriate type of coordination strategy is used. This
                 learning is accomplished by recording and analyzing
                 traces of inferences after problem solving. The
                 analysis results in identification of situations where
                 inappropriate coordination strategies have caused
                 redundant activities or the lack of timely execution of
                 important activities, thus degrading system
                 performance. Based on this identification,
                 situation-specific coordination plans are created which
                 use additional non-local information about activities
                 in the networks to remedy the problem. An example from
                 a real distributed problem-solving application
                 involving diagnosis of a local area network is

  abstract =     "This paper describes plan reuse in multiagent domains.
                 In distributed planning, a plan is created by
                 distributed centers of planner agents that have their
                 own viewpoints. Plan reuse where a past plan result is
                 reused for the new problem was proposed for
                 single-agent planning and can achieve efficient
                 planning. A special issue for applying it to
                 distributed planning is that, even if the local agent
                 thinks that the new problem is identical to a past
                 problem, other agents may have quite different goals.
                 Another issue is to realize efficient distributed
                 planning, like in a single-agent case. This paper shows
                 that the past plan can be reused regardless of other
                 agents' goals under the assumption that the initial
                 state has only ``in-facts.'' A generated plan and
                 related information are stored as a plan template so
                 that an agent can reuse it in future planning. This
                 information includes generated plans, subgoals,
                 non-local effects that may affect or be affected by
                 other agents' plans, and their conflict resolution
                 methods that were actually used. An agent can create a
                 plan efficiently using a template, because it can skip
                 a part of planning actions, detect conflicts in an
                 early stage, and reduce communication costs. First,
                 this paper presents the planning-with-reuse framework.
                 Then how plan templates are created and reused is also
                 illustrated using some block world examples. Finally,
                 we experimentally show that efficient distributed
                 planning can be achieved.",

  abstract =     "Agent tracking is an important capability that an
                 intelligent automated agent requires for interacting
                 with other agents. It involves monitoring the
                 observable actions of other agents as well as inferring
                 their unobserved actions or high-level plans, goals and
                 behaviors. This paper analyzes the challenges of agent
                 tracking in a {"}real-world{"}, dynamic, multi-agent
                 environment of air-combat simulation. An intelligent
                 automated pilot in this environment faces the challenge
                 of tracking the highly flexible actions and behaviors
                 of other individuals or groups of pilots, while
                 interacting with them, and dealing with imperfect
                 sensors and real-time pressures. The paper introduces
                 an approach for recursive agent tracking that enables
                 an automated pilot to meet this challenge, and even
                 take advantage of the imperfect sensors to engage in
                 deception. The paper introduces some optimizations to
                 address real-time pressures and presents experimental
                 data from an actual implementation to illustrate their
                 impact. Agents in other competitive or collaborative
                 dynamic multi-agent environments, such as {"}virtual
                 reality{"} environments, could conceivably benefit from
                 this agent tracking approach.",

                 a Multi-Agent System (MAS) which has been designed to
                 provide easy access to distributed heterogeneous
                 information and processes for a wide variety of users.
                 A basic agent model has been developed and is used to
                 characterize the agents of the MAS. Using this model
                 three classes of agents have been currently identified
                 and incorporated into the MAS testbed. These are: the
                 user interface agent which serves as the main point of
                 interaction between a user and the MAS; an agent
                 manager which is responsible for coordinating the
                 activities of a community of agents within the MAS; and
                 domain agents whose specialized knowledge enable them
                 to accomplish domain-specific tasks. In the context of
                 the MAS testbed we are able to address several research
                 issues such as user modeling, cooperative activity
                 among agents, handling incomplete requests, and
                 inter-agent and human user-to-agent interactions.",

  abstract =     "The modeling of cooperative processes has up to now
                 relied almost exclusively on traditional cognitive
                 approaches, employing explicit representations of
                 goals, beliefs and actions, as seen from an observer's
                 viewpoint, thus underemphasizing the role of internal
                 agent architectures. We propose here a generalized
                 tit-for-tat agent model that is completely reactive and
                 possesses the properties of adaptivity and scalability.
                 We show how this (socio)biological model can be used to
                 account for social behavior, i.e. behavior depending
                 explicitly on the interaction of an agent with other
                 agents in its environment. This is achieved through the
                 defi- nition of {"}social{"} objects or properties,
                 which can be abstract or have a material form, and that
                 are perceivable, accessible and manipulable by the
                 agents. Agents have internal, built-in, or else
                 genetic, motivations to regulate these
                 objects/properties to certain limits and act
                 accordingly. The result of those actions are then
                 visible and directly perceivable by all the agents of
                 the community who seek individually to satisfy their
                 internal needs according to this social feedback. To
                 deploy the potential of the approach, we present three
                 examples from different domains and de- monstrate on
                 several instantiations of the same basic model a
                 variety of social phenomena that derive from the
                 differential expression of those matching motivations
                 of individual agents. The power of the approach may be
                 partly attributed to the presence of genetic variations
                 in the agents' parameters which give rise to intricate
                 dynamics. Finally, we give a sketch of the level of
                 complexity that the system may attain and we briefly
                 expose its relation with predictive systems.",

                 other agents are important to consider when choosing an
                 action. Pruning away less important models allows an
                 agent to take its {"}best{"} action in a timely manner,
                 given its knowledge, computational abilities, and time
                 constraints. We describe a theoretical framewwork,

                 models and the strategies and expected strategies
                 associated with them. This framework allows us to

                 computational actionss is used to guide the pruning of

                 interaction, and explore its usefulness for interactive

  abstract =     "We consider a homogeneous cooperative multiagent
                 system organized as a multiply sectioned Bayesian
                 network (MSBN). Earlier work has shown that (1)
                 multiagent MSBNs can be applied to distributed
                 interpretation tasks; and (2) a distributed
                 communication operation can be used to ensure the
                 global consistency among agents. In this paper, we
                 address the following problem: During a communication
                 operation, each agent is unavailable to process new
                 evidence for a time interval (called off-line time). We
                 consider the minimization of total length of off-line
                 time of the entire system. To concentrate on the
                 factors affecting the off-line time, we abstract
                 communication in MSBNs into a graphical model for
                 off-line time study. Using the model, we present the
                 optimal schedules when communication is initiated from
                 an arbitrarily selected agent. We show now the optimal
                 schedules can be constructed in a distributed
                 fashion.",

                 constraint satisfaction problems called asynchronous
                 weak-commitment search. This algorithm removes the
                 common drawback of backtracking algorithms, i.e., one
                 bad decision in value selection becomes fatal when
                 solving large-scale problems, while its completeness is
                 guaranteed. The basic ideas of this algorithm are as
                 follows: (i) bad decisions are revised without an
                 exhaustive search by changing the priority order of
                 agents dynamically, (ii) the probability of bad
                 decisions being made is reduced by selecting values
                 cooperatively using the min-conflict heuristic [Minton
                 et al. 92]. Although these ideas are very simple and
                 domain independent, experimental results indicate that
                 this algorithm can solve large-scale problems, which

                 establishment of the priority order, and the
                 cooperative value selection considering the situations

                 systems with imperfect information can be extremely
                 complex. It was shown by Hogg and Huberman that when
                 agents can follow different strategies in a system with
                 resource contention, it is possible to render otherwise
                 unstable and chaotic behavior into equilibrium. In a
                 number of computer experiments we explore this
                 mechanism and find the existence of bursty behavior
                 which sporadically punctuates the existing equilibrium.
                 This phenomenon is shown to arise out of the underlying
                 fluctuations of the multiagent system. This mechanism
                 of equilibria punctuated by bursts of erratic activity
                 appears to be quite general in systems where agents
                 explore strategies in search of local improvements.",

  abstract =     "This paper deals with the consensus of uncertainties
                 in distributed expert systems (DESs). It claims that
                 the different uncertainties of a solution from
                 different expert systems constitute not only a conflict
                 case, but also non-conflict cases. We will refer both
                 the conflict case and non-conflict cases as synthesis
                 cases. The first objective of this paper is to classify
                 the synthesis {\it cases}, identify the {\it types} of
                 DESs, and recognize the {\it relationships} among the
                 different synthesis cases and the different types of
                 DESs. On the basis of this, a computational synthesis
                 strategy is proposed to obtain a consensus of
                 uncertainties in a conflict case. Within this strategy,
                 the conflict case is further classified into two
                 sub-cases, and two corresponding sub-strategies are
                 proposed, in which both uncertainties and authorities
                 are taken into consideration. A synthesis strategy
                 based on neural networks is also proposed in a conflict
                 case. In this strategy, as long as enough patterns have
                 been obtained from human experts, neural networks can
                 be trained to match all patterns. This strategy can
                 simulate human experts reasonably well. Tests have also
                 shown that a fixed neural network architecture can be
                 used to solve conflict problems, with a variable number
                 of inputs and outputs. That means only a small number
                 of neural networks are required to solve all conflicts,
                 thus the neural network can be used in real DESs.
                 Finally, a computational synthesis strategy is compared
                 to a neural network synthesis strategy. Both strategies
                 have advantage and disadvantage and are adapt to
                 different situations.",
