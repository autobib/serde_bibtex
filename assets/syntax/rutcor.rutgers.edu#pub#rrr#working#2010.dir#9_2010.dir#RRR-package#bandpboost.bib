	problem consists of finding a single logical conjunction that best

	Computing classifiers using boosting methods involves a maximum
	
	agreement subproblem at each iteration, although such subproblems
	are typically solved by heuristic methods. Here, we
	
	describe an exact branch and bound method for maximum agreement over
	
	Boolean monomials, improving on the earlier work of Goldberg and
	
	Shan. In particular, we develop a tighter upper
	
	bounding function and an improved branching procedure that exploits
	
	knowledge of the bound and the dataset, while having a lower branching
	
	factor. Experimental results show that the new method is able to
	
	solve larger problem instances and runs faster within a linear
	
	programming boosting procedure applied to medium-sized datasets from
	
	the UCI repository.},

  number = {RRR-23},
  abstract = {In optimization-based classification model selection, for example
	when using linear programming formulations, a standard approach is
	to penalize
	
	 the $L_1$ norm of some linear functional in order to select sparse
	models. 
	
	Instead, we propose a novel integer linear program for sparse
	
	classifier selection, generalizing the minimum disagreement hyperplane
	
	problem whose complexity has been investigated in computational
	
	learning theory. Specifically, our mixed-integer problem is that of
	
	finding a separating hyperplane with minimum empirical error subject
	
	to an $L_0$ penalty. We show that common ``soft margin'' linear
	
	programming formulations for robust classification are equivalent
	to a
	
	continuous relaxation of our model. Since the initial continuous
	
	relaxation is weak, we suggest a tighter relaxation, using novel
	
	cutting planes, to better approximate the integer solution. We
	
	describe a boosting algorithm, based on linear programming with
	
	dynamic generation of cuts and columns, that solves our relaxation.
	We
	
	demonstrate the classification performance of our proposed algorithm
	
	with experimental results, and justify our selection of parameters
	
	using a minimum description length, compression interpretation of
	
	learning.},
