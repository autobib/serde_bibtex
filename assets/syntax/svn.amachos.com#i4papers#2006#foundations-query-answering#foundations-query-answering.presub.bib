The nested algebra is a generalization of the flat relational algebra to manipulate nested relations. In this paper we study the expressive power of the nested algebra relative to its operation on flat relational databases. We show that the flat relational algebra is rich enough to extract the same ``flat information'' from a flat database as the nested algebra does. Theoretically, this result implies that recursive queries such as the transitive closure of a binary relation cannot be expressed in the nested algebra. Practically, this result is relevant to (flat) relational query optimization.}}

The algebra we present is a simple extension of the nested relation algebra. Our aim is to investigate how the use of bags in the language extends its expressive power, and increases its complexity. We consider two main issues, namely (i) the relationship between the depth of bag nesting and the expressive power, and (ii) the relationship between the algebraic operations, and their complexity and expressive power. We show that the bag algebra is more expressive than the nested relation algebra (at all levels of nesting), and that the difference may be subtle. We establish a hierarchy based on the structure of algebra expressions. This hierarchy is shown to be highly related to the properties of the powerset operator.}}

For example, new functionality is being added to SQL to support OLAP-style querying in which order is frequently an important aspect. The set- or multiset-based frameworks for query optimization that are currently being taught to database students are increasingly inadequate.This paper presents a foundation for query optimization that extends existing frameworks to also capture ordering. A list-based relational algebra is provided along with three progressively stronger types of algebraic equivalences, concrete query transformation rules that obey the different equivalences, and a procedure for determining which types of transformation rules are applicable for optimizing a query. The exposition follows the style chosen by many textbooks, making it relatively easy to teach this material in continuation of the material covered in the textbooks, and to integrate this material into the textbooks.}}

	Year = {1989},
	Abstract = {Database applications often require to evaluate queries
containing quantifiers or disjunctions, e.g., for handling general
integrity constraints. Existing efficient methods for processing
quantifiers depart from the relational model as they rely on
non-algebraic procedures. Looking at quantified query evaluation from
a new angle, we propose an approach to process quantifiers that makes
use of relational algebra operators only. Our approach performs in two
phases. The first phase normalizes the queries producing a canonical
form. This form permits to improve the translation into relational
algebra performed during the second phase. The improved translation
relies on a new operator - the complement-join - that generalizes the
set difference, on algebraic expressions of universal quantifiers that
avoid the expensive division operator in many cases, and on a special
processing of disjunctions by means of constrained outer-joins. Our
method achieves an efficiency at least comparable with that of
previous proposals, better in most cases. Furthermore, it is
considerably simpler to implement as it completely relies on
relational data structures and operators.}}

	Abstract = {This paper studies the complexity of evaluating functional query languages for complex values such as monad algebra and the recursion-free fragment of XQuery. We show that monad algebra with equality restricted to atomic values is complete for the class TA[2O(n),O(n)] of problems solvable in linear exponential time with a linear number of alternations. The monotone fragment of monad algebra with atomic value equality but without negation is complete for nondeterministic exponential time. For monad algebra with deep equality, we establish TA[2O(n),O(n)] lower and exponential-space upper bounds. Then we study a fragment of XQuery, Core XQuery, that seems to incorporate all the features of a query language on complex values that are traditionally deemed essential. A close connection between monad algebra on lists and Core XQuery (with ?child? as the only axis) is exhibited, and it is shown that these languages are expressively equivalent up to representation issues. We show that Core XQuery is just as hard as monad algebra w.r.t. combined complexity, and that it is in TC0 if the query is assumed fixed.}}

	Title = {Expressive power and data complexity of nonrecursive query languages for lists and trees (extended abstract)},
	Year = {2000},
	Abstract = {We extend the traditional query languages by primitives for handling lists and trees. Our main results characterize the expressive power and data complexity of the following extended languages: (1) relational algebra with lists and trees, (2) nonrecursive Datalog@@@@ with lists and trees, (3) nonrecursive Prolog with lists and trees, (4) first-order logic over lists and trees.Languages (2)-(4) turn out to have the same expressive power; their range-restricted fragments have the same expressive power as (1). Every query in these languages is a boolean combination of range-restricted queries.We also prove that these query languages have polynomial data complexity under any ``reasonable'' encoding of inputs. Furthermore, under a natural encoding of inputs, languages (2)-(4) have the same expressive power as first-order logic over finite structures, therefore their data complexity is in A Co. Thus, the use of lists and trees in nonrecursive query languages gives no gain in the expressiveness. This contrasts with a huge difference between the nonelementary program complexity of extended languages (2)-(4) and the PSPA CE program complexity of their relational counterparts.Our results partly explain why lists and trees are not so widely used in nonrecursive query languages as other collection types.

	 recommendation, based on a hierarchical and ordered document model, supports a
	 wide variety of constructs and use cases. There is a diversity of
	 approaches and strategies for evaluating XQuery expressions, in many
	 cases only dealing with limited subsets of the language. In this
	 paper we describe an implementation approach that handles XQuery with
	 arbitrarily-nested FLWR expressions, element constructors and built-in
	 functions (including structural comparisons). Our proposal maps an XQuery
	 expression to a single equivalent SQL query using a novel dynamic interval
	 encoding of a collection of XML documents as relations, augmented with
	 information tied to the query evaluation environment. The dynamic
	 interval technique enables (suitably enhanced) relational engines to
	 produce predictably good query plans that do not preclude the use of
	 sort-merge join query operators. The benefits are realized despite the
	 challenges presented by intermediate results that create arbitrary
	 documents and the need to preserve document order as prescribed by
	 semantics of XQuery. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate
	 that (native or relational) XML systems can benefit from the above
	 technique to avoid a quadratic scale up penalty that effectively
	 prevents the evaluation of nested FLWR expressions for large documents.}}

	Abstract = {Xcerpt is a declarative and pattern-based query and transformation
	 language for the Web with deductive capabilities. In contrast to
	 Web query languages like XQuery and XSLT, Xcerpt relies on concepts
	 and techniques from logic programming and automated theorem proving
	 such as declarative ?query patterns? and ?rule chaining?. Xcerpt can
	 also be used for querying Web metadata, like OWL or RDF data, and
	 reasoning on such metadata. In contrast to specific languages for OWL and
	 RDF, however, Xcerpt is a general purpose query, transformation, and
	 reasoning language, i.e. it can be used for reasoning not only with Web
	 metadata but also with plain Web data. Salient aspects of Xcerpt
	 are its nonstandard ?query patterns? for retrieving incompletely
	 specified data and its unusual ?grouping constructs? some and all that
	 significantly depart from the standard approaches in logic programming
	 or automated theorem proving. Xcerpt relies on a new, assymmetric
	 unification, called simulation unification for evaluating query patterns
	 that incompletely specify data. Furthermore, Xcerpt does not rely on
	 meta reasoning for expressing and processing ?grouping? constructs
	 corresponding to Prolog?s metalevel predicates setof and bagof. This article
	 gives a brief overview over challenges of applying logic programming
	 techniques to Web querying. In particular it suggests two different
	 approaches for treating the meta-level grouping constructs all and some in
	 a proof calculus formalising the operational semantics of Xcerpt.}}

It is based on matching theory and its complexity is low. In fact, for a constraint defined on a subset of p variables having domains of cardinality at most d, its space complexit is O(pd) and its time complexity is O(p2d2). This filtering algorithm has been successfully used in the system RESYN, to solve the subgraph isomorphism problem.}}

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.}}

Booth and Lueker (1976, J. Comput. System Sci. 13, 335-378) designed a linear time- testing algorithm for this property based on a data structure called "PQ-trees." This procedure is quite complicated and the linear-time-amortized analysis is also rather involved. We developed an off-line linear time test for the consecutive ones property without using PQ-trees and the corresponding template matching, which makes ours considerably simpler. A simplification of the consecutive ones test will immediately simplify algorithms (and computer codes) for interval-graph and planar-graph recognition. Our approach is based on a decomposition technique that separates the rows into prime subsets, each of which admits essentially a unique column ordering that realizes the consecutive ones property. The success of this approach is based on finding a good "row ordering" to be tested iteratively.}}

	Abstract = {Path expressions are ubiquitous in XML processing languages.
	 Existing approaches evaluate a path expression by selecting nodes that
	 satisfies the tag-name and value constraints and then joining them
	 according to the structural constraints. In this paper, we propose a
	 novel approach, next-of-kin (NoK) pattern matching, to speed up the
	 nodeselection step, and to reduce the join size significantly in the second
	 step. To efficiently perform NoK pattern matching, we also propose a
	 succinct XML physical storage scheme that is adaptive to updates
	 and streaming XML as well. Our performance results demonstrate that
	 the proposed storage scheme and path evaluation algorithm is highly
	 efficient and outperforms the other tested systems in most cases.}}

	 particular, we present the syntax and semantics of our language, aiming at
	 emulating the trigger definition and execution model of SQL3. An
	 active extension of XQuery arises nontrivial problems, related to the

	 plans built from simple, easy to implement and efficient operators.

	Abstract = {Several languages for querying and
	 transforming XML, including XML-QL, Quilt, and XQL, have been proposed.
	 However, these languages do not support ranked queries based on textual
	 similarity, in the spirit of traditional IR. Several extensions to
	 these XML query languages to support keyword search have been made,
	 but the resulting languages cannot express IR-style queries such as
	 "find books and CDs with similar titles." In some of these languages
	 keywords are used merely as boolean filters without support for true
	 ranked retrieval; others permit similarity calculations only between a
	 data value and a constant, and thus cannot express the above query.
	 WHIRL avoids both problems, but assumes relational data. We propose
	 ELIXIR, an expressive and efficient language for XML information
	 retrieval that extends XML-QL with a textual similarity operator
	 that can be used for similarity joins, so ELIXIR is sufficiently
	 expressive to handle the sample query above. ELIXIR thus qualifies as a
	 general-purpose XML IR query language. Our central contribution is an efficient
	 algorithm for answering ELIXIR queries that rewrites the original
	 ELIXIR query into a series of XML-QL queries to generate intermediate
	 relational data, and uses WHIRL to efficiently evaluate the similarity
	 operators on this intermediate data, yielding an XML document with
	 nodes ranked by similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that our
	 prototype scales well with the size of the query and the XML data.}}

This paper extends the relational model to include multiset relations, i.e., relations with duplicate tuples. It considers three formalisms for expressing queries in this model: extended relational algebra, tableaux, and DAPLEX. It shows that, as in the original algebra, the equivalence problem for conjunctive expressions in the extended algebra can be solved using tableaux, and is NP-complete. Finally, it demonstrates that the extended algebra and DAPLEX have essentially the same expressiveness relative to conjunctive expressions.}}

	Abstract = {The Semantic Web is still a vision. The unstructured Web of
	 today contains millions of documents which cannot be queried and
	 where layout and structure are heavily mixed. Moreover, they are not
	 annotated at all. There is a huge gap between Web information and
	 the qualified, structured data as required in corporate information
	 systems. According to the vision of the Semantic Web, all information
	 available on the Web will be suitably structured, annotated, and
	 qualified in the future. However, until this goal is reached, and
	 also, towards a faster achievement of this goal, relevant data can be
	 (semi-)automatically extracted from HTML documents and automatically translated
	 into a structured format, e.g., XML. A program that automatically
	 extracts data and transforms it into another format (markups the content
	 with semantic information) is called a wrapper. Intelligent content
	 extraction provides the foundation for automatic generation of semantic
	 markup. Various approaches to automatic content extraction have been
	 proposed, ranging from machine learning techniques to pattern recognition
	 techniques. However, these approaches in general fail to produce
	 useful results due to the complexity of Web pages. Other approaches
	 suggest the manual editing of script files that wrap the relevant
	 data from Web pages into more structured formats. Such processes are
	 time-consuming, hard to understand for non-technical wrapper designers, and
	 script files are not easy to maintain. We propose another approach - a
	 supervised and visual definition of content extraction. Based on
	 interactively identifying and extracting relevant parts of HTML documents and
	 translating content to XML format, we designed and implemented the
	 efficient wrapper generation tool Lixto Visual Wrapper [2] which is
	 well-suited for building HTML to XML wrappers. Such a wrappeapplied to
	 continually extract relevant information from this class of Web pages.}}

	Abstract = {Guarded fixed-point logic mGF extends the guarded fragment by means of least and greatest fixed points, and thus plays the same role within the domain of guarded logics as the modal m-calculus plays within the modal domain. We provide a semantic characterization of mGF within an appropriate fragment of second-order logic, in terms of invariance under guarded bisimulation. The corresponding characterization of the modal m-calculus, due to Janin and Walukiewicz, is lifted from the modal to the guarded domain by means of model theoretic translations. Guarded second-order logic, the fragment of second-order logic which is introduced in the context of our characterization theorem, captures a natural and robust level of expressiveness with several equivalent characterizations. For a wide range of issues in guarded logics it may take up a role similar to that of monadic second-order in relation to modal logics. At the more general methodological level, the translations between the guarded and modal domains make the intuitive analogy between guarded and modal logics available as a tool in the further analysis of the model theory of guarded logics.}}

	 Furthermore, BBQ allows users to query data sources with loose or incomplete

	Abstract = {Order-based element labeling for tree-structured XML
	 data is an important technique in XML processing. It lies at the
	 core of many fundamental XML operations such as containment join
	 and twig matching. While labeling for static XML documents is well
	 understood, less is known about how to maintain accurate labeling for
	 dynamic XML documents, when elements and subtrees are inserted and
	 deleted. Most existing approaches do not work well for arbitrary
	 update patterns; they either produce unacceptably long labels or incur
	 enormous relabeling costs. We present two novel I/O-efficient data
	 structures, W-BOX and B-BOX, that efficiently maintain labeling for large,
	 dynamic XML documents. We show analytically and experimentally that
	 both, despite consuming minimal amounts of storage, gracefully handle
	 arbitrary update patterns without sacrificing lookup efficiency.
	 The two structures together provide a nice tradeoff between update
	 and lookup costs: W-BOX has logarithmic amortized update cost and
	 constant worst-case lookup cost, while B-BOX has constant amortized
	 update cost and logarithmic worst-case lookup cost. We further propose
	 techniques to eliminate the lookup cost for read-heavy workloads.}}

	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {XML has a tree-structured data model, which is used to
	 uniformly represent structured as well as semi-structured data, and
	 also enable concise query specification in XQuery, via the use of
	 its XPath (twig) patterns. This in turn can leverage the recently
	 developed technology of structural join algorithms to evaluate the query
	 efficiently. In this paper, we identify a fundamental tension in XML data
	 modeling: (i) data represented as deep trees (which can make effective
	 use of twig patterns) are often un-normalized, leading to update
	 anomalies, while (ii) normalized data tends to be shallow, resulting in
	 heavy use of expensive value-based joins in queries.Our solution
	 to this data modeling problem is a novel multi-colored trees (MCT)
	 logical data model, which is an evolutionary extension of the XML data
	 model, and permits trees with multi-colored nodes to signify their
	 participation in multiple hierarchies. This adds significant semantic
	 structure to individual data nodes. We extend XQuery expressions to
	 navigate between structurally related nodes, taking color into account,
	 and also to create new colored trees as restructurings of an MCT
	 database. While MCT serves as a significant evolutionary extension
	 to XML as a logical data model, one of the key roles of XML is for
	 information exchange. To enable exchange of MCT information, we develop
	 algorithms for optimally serializing an MCT database as XML. We discuss
	 alternative physical representations for MCT databases, using relational
	 and native XML databases, and describe an implementation on top of
	 the Timber native XML database. Experimental evaluation, using our
	 prototype implementation, shows that not only are MCT queries/updates
	 more succinct and easier to express than equivalent shallow tree
	 XML queries, but they can also be significantly more efficient to
	 evaluate than equivalent deep and shallow tree XML queries/updates.}}

	 programming under the answer set semantics with the description logics
	 SHIF(D) and SHOIN(D), which underly the Web ontology languages OWL
	 Lite and OWL DL, respectively. This combination allows for building
	 rules on top of ontologies but also, to a limited extent, building
	 ontologies on top of rules. We introduce description logic programs
	 (dl-programs), which consist of a description logic knowledge base L and a
	 finite set of description logic rules (dl-rules) P. Such rules are
	 similar to usual rules in logic programs with negation as failure, but
	 may also contain queries to L, possibly default negated, in their
	 bodies. We define Herbrand models for dl-programs, and show that
	 satisfiable positive dl-programs have a unique least Herbrand model.
	 More generally, consistent stratified dlprograms can be associated
	 with a unique minimal Herbrand model that is characterized through
	 iterative least Herbrand models. We then generalize the (unique) minimal
	 Herbrand model semantics for positive and strati- fied dl-programs to a
	 strong answer set semantics for all dl-programs, which is based on a
	 reduction to the least model semantics of positive dl-programs. We also
	 de- fine a weak answer set semantics based on a reduction to the
	 answer sets of ordinary logic programs. Strong answer sets are weak
	 answer sets, and both properly generalize answer sets of ordinary
	 normal logic programs. We then give fixpoint characterizations for the
	 (unique) minimal Herbrand model semantics of positive and stratified
	 dl-programs, and show how to compute these models by finite fixpoint
	 iterations. Furthermore, we give a precise picture of the complexity
	 of deciding strong and weak answer set existence for a dl-program.}}

	Abstract = {As XQuery is gathering momentum as the standard query language for XML, there
	 is a growing interest in using it as an integral part of the XML
	 application development infrastructure. In that context, one question
	 which is often raised is how well XQuery interoperates with other XML
	 languages, and notably with XSLT. XQuery 1.0 [16] and XSLT 2.0 [7]
	 share a lot in common: they share XPath 2.0 as a common sub-language
	 and have the same expressiveness. However, they are based on fairly
	 different programming paradigms. While XSLT has adopted a highly
	 declarative template based approach, XQuery relies on a simpler, and more
	 operational, functional approach.In this paper, we present an approach to
	 compile XSLT 2.0 into XQuery 1.0, and a working implementation of that
	 approach. The compilation rules explain how XSLT's template-based
	 approach can be implemented using the functional approach of XQuery and
	 underpins the tight connection between the two languages. The resulting
	 compiler can be used to migrate a XSLT code base to XQuery, or to
	 enable the use of XQuery runtimes (e.g., as will soon be provided
	 by most relational database management systems) for XSLT users. We
	 also identify a number of areas where compatibility between the two
	 languages could be improved. Finally, we show experiments on actual XSLT
	 stylesheets, demonstrating the applicability of the approach in practice.}}

	Abstract = {The use of markup languages like SGML, HTML or XML
	 for encoding the strucutre of documents or linguistic data has lead
	 to many databases where entries are adequately described as trees.
	 In this context querying formalisms are interesting that offer the
	 possiblity to refer both to textual content and logical structure. We
	 consider models where the strucutre specified in a query is not only
	 used as a filter, but also for selecting and presenting different
	 parts of the data. If answers are formalized as mapping from query
	 nodes to the database, a simple enumeration of all mappings in the
	 answer set will often suffer from the effect that many answers have
	 common subparts. From a theoretical point of view this may lead to an
	 exponential time complexity of the computation and presentation of all

	 the maximal depth of a path of the database. An algorithm is given
	 that computes a complete answer aggregate for a given treee query
	 in time &sgr;(d?log(d)?h?). For the sublanguage of so-called rigid

	 improved bound of :&sgr;(d?log(d)?q) is obtained. The algorithm is based
	 on a specific index structure that supports practical efficiency.}}

These basically consist of the concatenation of factors where each factor is a disjunction of strings possibly extended with ` ' or ` '. We obtain lower and upper bounds for various fragments of simple regular expressions. Although we show that inclusion and intersection are already intractable for very weak expressions, we also identify some tractable cases. For equivalence, we only prove an initial tractability result leaving the complexity of more general cases open. The main motivation for this research comes from database theory, or more specifically XML and semi-structured data. We namely show that all lower and upper bounds for inclusion and equivalence, carry over to the corresponding decision problems for extended context-free grammars and single-type tree grammars, which are abstractions of DTDs and XML Schemas, respectively. For intersection, we show that the complexity only carries over for DTDs.}}

We give tight P-bounds for the simple XPath containment problem and tight NP bounds for the disjunction free subfragment while even identifying a PTIME subcase We also show that decidability of containment under SXIC s still holds if the expressions contain certain additional features, e.g. wildcard although the complexity jumps to P even for the disjunction free subfragment. We know that our results can be extended to some but not all of the XPath features that depend on document order The decidability of containment of simple XPath expressions in the presence of DTDs only remains open although we can show that the problem is PSPACE hard as well as the problem for full edged XPath expressions even in the absence of integrity constraints.}}

	 context of semistructured knowledge bases, where the basic querying
	 mechanism, namely regular path queries, asks for all pairs of objects
	 that are connected by a path conforming to a regular expression.
	 We consider conjunctive regular path queries with inverse, which
	 extend regular path queries with the possibility of using both the
	 inverse of binary relations, and conjunctions of atoms, where each atom
	 specifies that one regular path query with inverse holds between
	 two variables. We present a novel technique to check containment of
	 queries in this class, based on the use of two-way finite automata. The
	 technique shows the power of two-way automata in dealing with the inverse
	 operator and with the variables in the queries. We also characterize the
	 computational complexity of both the proposed algorithm and the problem.}}

	Abstract = {XPath is simple query language for XML documents which allows navigating in
XML trees and returning a set of matching nodes. It is used in XML Schema to
define keys and in XLink and XPointer to reference portions of documents.
XPath is a fundamental part of the XSLT and XQuery languages as it allows
definition of matching expressions for patterns and provides node selectors to
filter elements in the transformations.
We propose to study the containment and equivalence of XPath expressions
using an inference system combined with a rewriting system. The inference
system allows assertion and proof of properties on a class of expressions. In
order to keep the proof system compact, we propose a re-writing architecture
which allows transformation of remaining expressions in a disjunctive normal
form compatible with this class. In contrast with model based approaches, the
inference and rewriting systems are applied to the XPath language directly. We
believe this will help understanding the underlying issues of deciding
containment on the language itself.}}

	 XML is now widely used for modelling and storing structured text

	 result. Index structures with ranking support are therefore needed
	 for fast access to relevant parts of large document collections.
	 This paper proposes a classification scheme for both XML ranking
	 models and index structures, allowing to determine which index suits
	 which ranking model. An analysis reveals that ranking parameters
	 related to both the content and structure of the data are poorly
	 supported by most known XML indices. The IR-CADG index, owing to its
	 tight integration of content and structure, supports various XML
	 ranking models in a very efficient retrieval process. Experiments show
	 that it outperforms separate content/structure indexing by more than
	 two orders of magnitude for large corpora of several hundred MB.}}

	Abstract = {In this paper, we ask if the

	 covering indexes have analogs for branching path expression queries
	 over tree- or graph-structured XML data. Our answer is yes --- the
	 forward-and-backward index already proposed in the literature can
	 be viewed as a structure analogous to a summary table or covering
	 index. We also show that it is the smallest such index that covers all
	 branching path expression queries. While this index is very general, our
	 experiments show that it can be so large in practice as to offer
	 little performance improvement over evaluating queries directly on the
	 data. Likening the forward-and-backward index to a covering index on
	 all the attributes of several tables, we devise an index definition
	 scheme to restrict the class of branching path expressions being
	 indexed. The resulting index structures are dramatically smaller and
	 perform better than the full forward-and-backward index for these
	 classes of branching path expressions. This is roughly analogous
	 to the situation in multidimensional or OLAP workloads, in which
	 more highly aggregated summary tables can service a smaller subset
	 of queries but can do so at increased performance. We evaluate the
	 performance of our indexes on both relational decompositions of XML and a
	 native storage technique. As expected, the performance benefit of
	 an index is maximized when the query matches the index definition.}}

	Abstract = {Nowadays, we are required to
	 deal with more complex data, prime examples of which are data on
	 the Web, XML data, biological data, etc. There are already proposed
	 abstractions to handle these kinds of data, in particular in terms of
	 semistructured data models. A semistructured model conceives a database
	 essentially as a finite directed labeled graph whose nodes represent
	 objects, and whose edges represent relationships between objects. In
	 this paper, we focus on path queries, which are considered the basic
	 querying mechanism for semistructured data. In essence, such queries are
	 used to navigate, or discover paths that conform to specifications
	 captured by regular expressions. In order to make the navigation more

	 language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically
	 access and update the content, structure and style of documents.
	 The Document Object Model provides a standard set of objects for
	 representing HTML and XML documents, a standard model of how these
	 objects can be combined, and a standard interface for accessing and
	 manipulating them. Vendors can support the DOM as an interface to their
	 proprietary data structures and APIs, and content authors can write
	 to the standard DOM interfaces rather than product-specific APIs,
	 thus increasing interoperability on the Web. The goal of the DOM
	 specification is to define a programmatic interface for XML and HTML. The DOM
	 Level 1 specification is separated into two parts: Core and HTML. The
	 Core DOM Level 1 section provides a low-level set of fundamental
	 interfaces that can represent any structured document, as well as
	 defining extended interfaces for representing an XML document. These
	 extended XML interfaces need not be implemented by a DOM implementation
	 that only provides access to HTML documents; all of the fundamental
	 interfaces in the Core section must be implemented. A compliant DOM
	 implementation that implements the extended XML interfaces is required to
	 also implement the fundamental Core interfaces, but not the HTML
	 interfaces. The HTML Level 1 section provides additional, higher-level
	 interfaces that are used with the fundamental interfaces defined in the
	 Core Level 1 section to provide a more convenient view of an HTML
	 document. A compliant implementation of the HTML DOM implements all
	 of the fundamental Core interfaces as well as the HTML interfaces.}}

They presented an O(n6) algorithm for minimizing TPQs in the presence of only required-child and required-descendant constraints (i.e., no subtypes allowed; Case 3).

Despite a considerable body of research on the optimization of such queries over tree-shaped XML data, little attention has been paid so far to efficient access to graph-shaped XML, RDF, or Topic Maps. We propose the first evaluation technique for n-ary conjunctive queries that applies to both tree- and graph-shaped data and retains the same complexity as the best known approaches that are restricted to tree-shaped data only. Furthermore, the approach treats tree and graph-shaped queries uniformly without sacrificing evaluation complexity on the restricted query class. The core of the evaluation technique is based on dynamic programming using a memoization data structure, called "memoization matrix". It can be populated and consumed in different ways. For each of population and consumption, we propose two resp. three algorithms each having their own advantages. The complexity of the algorithms is compared analytically and experimentally.}}

	Abstract = {With the growing importance of
	 semi-structure data in information exchange, much research has been done
	 to provide an effective mechanism to match a twig query in an XML
	 database. A number of algorithms have been proposed recently to process a
	 twig query holistically. Those algorithms are quite efficient for
	 quires with only ancestor-descendant edges. But for queries with mixed
	 ancestor-descendant and parent-child edges, the previous approaches
	 still may produce large intermediate results, even when the input and
	 output size are more manageable. To overcome this limitation, in
	 this paper, we propose a novel holistic twig join algorithm, namely
	 <i>TwigStackList</i>. Our main technique is to look-ahead read some
	 elements in input data steams and cache limited number of them to
	 <i>lists</i> in the main memory. The number of elements in any list is
	 bounded by the length of the longest path in the XML document. We
	 show that <i>TwigStackList</i> is I/O optimal for queries with only
	 ancestor-descendant relationships below branching nodes. Further, even when
	 queries contain parent-child relationship below branching nodes, the
	 set of intermediate results in <i>TwigStackList</i> is guaranteed
	 to be a subset of that in previous algorithms. We complement our
	 experimental results on a range of real and synthetic data to show
	 the significant superiority of <i>TwigStackList</i> over previous
	 algorithms for queries with <i>parent</i>-<i>child</i> relationships.}}

	Abstract = {Peer data management systems (PDMS) offer a flexible architecture for decentralized
	 data sharing. In a PDMS, every peer is associated with a schema that
	 represents the peer's domain of interest, and semantic relationships
	 between peers are provided locally between pairs (or small sets) of
	 peers. By traversing semantic paths of mappings, a query over one peer
	 can obtain relevant data from any reachable peer in the network.
	 Semantic paths are traversed by reformulating queries at a peer into
	 queries on its neighbors.Naively following semantic paths is highly
	 inefficient in practice. We describe several techniques for optimizing the
	 reformulation process in a PDMS and validate their effectiveness
	 using real-life data sets. In particular, we develop techniques for
	 pruning paths in the reformulation process and for minimizing the
	 reformulated queries as they are created. In addition, we consider
	 the effect of the strategy we use to search through the space of
	 reformulations. Finally, we show that pre-computing semantic paths
	 in a PDMS can greatly improve the efficiency of the reformulation
	 process. Together, all of these techniques form a basis for scalable
	 query reformulation in PDMS.To enable our optimizations, we developed
	 practical algorithms, of independent interest, for checking containment
	 and minimization of XML queries, and for composing XML mappings.}}

	Abstract = {Query processing over XML data sources has
	 emerged as a popular topic. XML is an ordered data model and XQuery
	 expressions return results that have a well-defined order. However
	 little work on how order is supported in XML query processing has
	 been done to date. In this paper we study the challenges related
	 to handling order in the XML context, namely challenges imposed by
	 the XML data model, by the variety of distinct XML operators and by
	 incremental view maintenance. We have proposed an efficient solution
	 that addresses these issues. We use a key encoding for XML nodes
	 that supports both node identity and node order. We have designed
	 order encoding rules based on the XML algebraic query execution data
	 model and on node encodings that does not require any actual sorting
	 for intermediate results during execution. Our approach supports
	 more efficient incremental view maintenance as it makes most XML
	 operators distributive with respect to bag union. Our approach is
	 implemented in the context of Rainbow [25], an XML data management system
	 developed at WPI. We prove the correctness of our order encoding
	 approach, namely that it ensures order handling for query processing and
	 for view maintenance. We also show, through experiments, that the
	 overhead of maintaining order in our approach is indeed neglectible.}}

	Abstract = {XML is nowadays the de facto standard for
	 electronic data interchange on the Web. Available XML data ranges from
	 small Web pages to ever-growing repositories of, e.g., biological and
	 astronomical data, and even to rapidly changing and possibly unbounded
	 streams, as used in Web data integration and publish-subscribe systems.
	 Animated by the ubiquity of XML data, the basic task of XML querying is
	 becoming of great theoretical and practical importance. The last years
	 witnessed efforts as well from practitioners, as also from theoreticians
	 towards defining an appropriate XML query language. At the core of
	 this common effort has been identified a navigational approach for
	 information localization in XML data, comprised in a practical and simple
	 query language called XPath [1]. This work brings together the two
	 aforementioned ?worlds?, i.e., the XPath query evaluation and the XML data
	 streams, and shows as well theoretical as also practical relevance
	 of this fusion. Its relevance can not be subsumed by traditional
	 database management systems, because the latter are not designed for
	 rapid and continuous loading of individual data items, and do not
	 directly support the continuous queries that are typical for stream
	 applications. The first central contribution of this work consists in the
	 definition and the theoretical investigation of three term rewriting
	 systems to rewrite queries with reverse predicates, like parent or
	 ancestor, into equivalent forward queries, i.e., queries without
	 reverse predicates. Our rewriting approach is vital to the evaluation
	 of queries with reverse predicates against unbounded XML streams,
	 because neither the storage of past fragments of the stream, nor
	 several stream traversals, as required by the evaluation of reverse
	 predicates, are affordable. Beyond their declared main purpose of providing
	 equivalences between queries with reverse predicates and forward
	 queries, the applications of our rewriting systems shed light on
	 other query language properties, like the expressivity of some of its
	 fragments, the query minimization, or even the complexity of query
	 evaluation. For example, using these systems, one can rewrite any
	 graph query into an equivalent forward forest query. The second main
	 contribution consists in a streamed and progressive evaluation strategy of
	 forward queries against XML streams. The evaluation is specified
	 using compositions of so-called stream processing functions, and is
	 implemented using networks of deterministic pushdown transducers. The
	 complexity of this evaluation strategy is polynomial in both the
	 query and the data sizes for forward forest queries and even for
	 a large fragment of graph queries. The third central contribution
	 consists in two real monitoring applications that use directly the
	 results of this work: the monitoring of processes running on UNIX
	 computers, and a system for providing graphically real-time traffic and
	 travel information, as broadcasted within ubiquitous radio signals.}}

	Abstract = {During the last three or four years several investigators have been exploring ``semantic models'' for formatted databases. The intent is to capture (in a more or less formal way) more of the meaning of the data so that database design can become more systematic and the database system itself can behave more intelligently. Two major thrusts are clear. (1) the search for meaningful units that are as small as possible---atomic semantics; (2) the search for meaningful units that are larger than the usual n-ary relation---molecular semantics. In this paper we propose extensions to the relational model to support certain atomic and molecular semantics. These extensions represent a synthesis of many ideas from the published work in semantic modeling plus the introduction of new rules for insertion, update, and deletion, as well as new algebraic operators.}}

	Abstract = {Universal quantification is not supported directly in most database systems despite the fact that it adds significant power to a system's query processing and inference capabilities, in particular for the analysis of many-to-many relationships and of set-valued attributes. One of the main reasons for this omission has been that universal quantification algorithms and their performance have not been explored for large databases. In this article, we describe and compare three known algorithms and one recently proposed algorithm for relational division, the algebra operator that embodies universal quantification. For each algorithm, we investigate the performance effects of explicit duplicate removal and referential integrity enforcement, variants for inputs larger than memory, and parallel execution strategies. Analytical and experimental performance comparisons illustrate the substantial differences among the algorithms. Moreover, comparisons demonstrate that the recently proposed division algorithm evaluates a universal quantification predicate over two relations as fast as hash (semi-) join evaluates an existential quantification predicate over the same relations. Thus, existential and universal quantification can be supported with equal efficiency by adding the recently proposed algorithm to a query evaluation system. A second result of our study is that universal quantification should be expressed directly in a database query language, because most query optimizers do not recognize the rather indirect formulations available in SQL as relational division and therefore produce very poor evaluation plans for many universal quantification queries.}}

	Abstract = {This paper introduces an algebraic framework for expressing
	 and evaluating queries over XML data. It presents the underlying
	 assumptions of the framework, describes the input and output of the
	 algebraic operators, and de nes these operators and their semantics. It
	 evaluates the framework with regard to other proposed XML query algebras.
	 Examples show that this framework is flexible enough to capture queries
	 expressed in Quilt, one of the dominant XML query languages. We have used
	 this algebra in the context of an Internet query engine, in which it
	 is used to formulate logical plans for XML-QL queries. We define
	 equivalence rules that provide opportunities for optimization, and
	 give example cases that point out the usefulness of these rules.}}

Some of the advanced material has never before been presented in book form. The style is rigorous, with detailed proofs and many exercises. The text and numerous examples highlight the intuition underlying the development. As a textbook, the book is aimed at graduate students and seniors who would use it as the main text in a database theory course, or as complementary material in a database systems course. It can also serve as a reference for database researchers and for other computer scientists interested in databases.},
	Annote = {Database theory is a relative newcomer to the field of computer science. Early data management systems were based on techniques from several classical areas of computer science, ranging from hardware and operating systems to data structures and programming languages. In the early seventies, a leap of abstraction from file systems produced relational databases and its accompanying theory, with logic as the catalyst. We believe that database theory has matured--that is has emerged as an elegant and robust part of science with its own identity. As such, it embodies its own peculiar brand of wisdom that deserves to be communicated not just to insiders, but to the computer science community at large.
In a nutshell, a database management system is a software system that enables the creation, maintenance, and use of large amounts of data. In contrast with many programming applications, the logical data structure--the "database schema"--used to structure a given data set is usually much smaller than the volume of that set. Furthermore, the data is persistent, evolving over time and surviving multiple invocations of the database management software. To increase usability, concurrent access to the data is usually supported with specialized protocols that guarantee a form of noninterference between interleaved transactions. Importantly, modern database management systems embody a distinction between the logical level and the physical level. The logical level focuses on an abstract representation of the data, along with languages to create, query and modify it; the physical level focuses on the underlying implementation, including the physical layout used to store the data, the indexing and clustering schemes, and the concurrency and recovery protocols.

Database theory has developed primarily around the logical level of database. (A notable exception is concurrency control, which is not addressed in this volume.) A core of fundamental material on the relational model has become well established. It consists primarily of three paradigms for query languages (algebraic, calculus-based, and deductive) and the theory of dependencies. The theory of query languages, including issues of expressiveness and complexity specific to databases, is well developed. The marriage between databases and logic programming produced deductive databases, with the main focus on the deductive query languages. Dependency theory focused initially on formalizing and applying the disparate integrity constraints that commonly arise in practice, and it went on to relate constraints with query optimization and to develop a unifying perspective for them.

As a field, database theory draws on several areas, including mathematical logic, complexity, and programming languages. But the database context brings with it different assumptions, perspectives, and emphases. Relations can be viewed as predicates in the sense of logic, and the relational calculus as a specialization of the first-order predicate calculus. However, the database area emphasizes finite structures and has developed the notions of "domain independence" and "safety" to capture intuitive properties related to this finitude. The questions and techniques in dependency theory borrow heavily from logic., with a focus on practically motivated, relatively weak classes of sentences. Query languages provide an interesting contrast with conventional, imperative programming languages. Query languages typically embody a set-at-a-time focus as opposed to an object-at-a-time focus. Also, they are largely declarative in nature, and failing that, are more applicative than imperative. Because of the emphasis on tractability in the face of large volumes of data, there is considerable interest in query languages that do not have full computational power, which gives rise to a rich interplay between query languages and complexity theory. Specialized notions of complexity have arisen, stemming from the practical reality of large volumes of data and the theoretical interest in different query languages. Also, the important notion of 'genericity," which captures a form of abstraction stemming from the separation of the logical and physical levels, has led to new perspectives on complexity theory, involving formalisms that circumvent the ordering of input data implicit in traditional Turing machines.

Exciting new research directions have continued to emerge in database theory, stemming primarily from unanswered questions about query languages and from an interest in expanding beyond the limitations of the relational model. Current research includes investigations motivated by connections with object-orientation, artificial intelligence, and graphics interfaces. And as the database field matures, it, in turn, influences adjacent areas in computer science, notably finite model theory, programming languages, and logic programming.}}

	Abstract = {Finding all the occurrences of a twig pattern in an XML database is a core operation for efficient evaluation of XML queries. A number of algorithms have been proposed to process a twig query based on region encoding labeling scheme. While region encoding supports efficient determination of structural relationship between two elements, we observe that the information within a single label is very limited. In this paper, we propose a new labeling scheme, called extended Dewey. This is a powerful labeling scheme, since from the label of an element alone, we can derive all the elements names along the path from the root to the element. Based on extended Dewey, we design a novel holistic twig join algorithm, called TJFast. Unlike all previous algorithms based on region encoding, to answer a twig query, TJFast only needs to access the labels of the leaf query nodes. Through this, not only do we reduce disk access, but we also support the efficient evaluation of queries with wildcards in branching nodes, which is very difficult to be answered by algorithms based on region encoding. Finally, we report our experimental results to show that our algorithms are superior to previous approaches in terms of the number of elements scanned, the size of intermediate results and query performance.}}

In this paper many different algorithms that compute approximate solutions for optimizing join orders are studied since traditional dynamic programming techniques are not appropriate for complex problems. Two possible solution spaces, the space of left-deep and bushy processing trees, are evaluated from a statistical point of view. The result is that the common limitation to left-deep processing trees is only advisable for certain join graph types. Basically, optimizers from three classes are analysed: heuristic, randomized and genetic algorithms. Each one is extensively scrutinized with respect to its working principle and its fitness for the desired application. It turns out that randomized and genetic algorithms are well suited for optimizing join expressions. They generate solutions of high quality within a reasonable running time. The benefits of heuristic optimizers, namely the short running time, are often outweighed by merely moderate optimization performance.}}

	Year = {2002},
	Abstract = {XML employs a tree-structured data model, and, naturally, XML queries specify patterns of
	 selection predicates on multiple elements related by a tree structure.
	 Finding all occurrences of such a twig pattern in an XML database is a
	 core operation for XML query processing. Prior work has typically
	 decomposed the twig pattern into binary structural (parent-child and
	 ancestor-descendant) relationships, and twig matching is achieved by: (i) using
	 structural join algorithms to match the binary relationships against
	 the XML database, and (ii) stitching together these basic matches.
	 A limitation of this approach for matching twig patterns is that
	 intermediate result sizes can get large, even when the input and
	 output sizes are more manageable.In this paper, we propose a novel
	 holistic twig join algorithm, TwigStack, for matching an XML query twig
	 pattern. Our technique uses a chain of linked stacks to compactly
	 represent partial results to root-to-leaf query paths, which are
	 then composed to obtain matches for the twig pattern. When the twig
	 pattern uses only ancestor-descendant relationships between elements,
	 TwigStack is I/O and CPU optimal among all sequential algorithms
	 that read the entire input: it is linear in the sum of sizes of the
	 input lists and the final result list, but independent of the sizes
	 of intermediate results. We then show how to use (a modification
	 of) B-trees, along with TwigStack, to match query twig patterns in
	 sub-linear time. Finally, we complement our analysis with experimental
	 results on a range of real and synthetic data, and query twig patterns.}}

	Abstract = {A lot of work is being done in the database community on mapping of XML data
	 into and out of relational database systems, specifically, the query
	 processing over such data using XQuery. We discuss our solution, the XML
	 Algebra Tree (XAT), as part of our larger XML management system called
	 Rainbow.Rainbow uses XQuery to describe the loading and extracting of XML
	 data into relational systems and also for the execution of queries
	 against pre-defined XML views of that stored data. The XML algebra tree
	 of the query against those views is merged with the queries that
	 define the views to form a larger tree. Because the XML formatting
	 operators are interleaved with the computation operators, this XAT
	 must then be optimized before being translated into one or more SQL
	 statements that can be executed on the database. SQL translation is
	 composed of computation pushdown and SQL generation.The computation
	 pushdown splits the tree into the XML-specific and SQL-doable operators,
	 which is then going to be converted into SQL statements. However, the
	 XAT after computation pushdown may contain unreferenced columns or
	 unused operators. Leaving these operators in the tree will create
	 unnecessarily large SQL statements and will slow down the overall
	 execution.Our main contributions to XML query processing, outlined in
	 this paper, are threefold. One, we describe an algebra based on XATs
	 for modeling XQuery expressions. Two, we propose rewriting rules to
	 optimize XQueries by XAT operator cancel out. Lastly, we show a cutting
	 algorithm to remove unreferenced columns and operators from the trees. We
	 have fully implemented the techniques discussed in this paper in
	 the Rainbow system. A preliminary experimental study compares the
	 performance of execution before and after operator cancel out and cutting.}}

	Abstract = {Mapping of XML data into and out of relational database
	 systems, including query processing over such virtual XML views that
	 wrap relational sources, has become a topic of critical importance
	 recently. The Rainbow XML data management system, being developed at
	 WPI, focuses on the processing and optimization of XQuery queries
	 against XML views over relational data. For this, Rainbow?s query
	 model, the XML Algebra Tree (XAT), has been designed. Because the XML
	 formatting operators are interleaved with the computation operators, this
	 XAT must first be optimized before being translated into SQL. Our
	 computation pushdown technology handles this optimization by splitting
	 the XAT into the XML-specific and SQL-doable operators, with the
	 later then being converted into SQL statements. However, the XAT
	 after computation pushdown may contain unreferenced columns or unused
	 operators. We show that these unneeded operators cannot be discovered by
	 the relational engine after SQL generation. Leaving these operators
	 in the tree would create unnecessarily large SQL statements that
	 will slow down the overall execution. Our main contributions to XML

A mutant gene is obtained by alteration of some connected portion of this structure. By examining data obtained from suitable experiments, it can be determined whether or not the blemished portions of two mutant genes intersect or not, and thus intersection data for a large number of mutants can be represented as an undirected graph. If this graph is an "interval graph," then the observed data is consistent with a linear model of the gene. 
The problem of determining when a graph is an interval graph is a special case of the following problem concerning (0, l)-matrices: When can the rows of such a matrix be per- muted so as to make the l's in each column appear consecutively? A complete theory is obtained for this latter problem, culminating in a decomposition theorem which leads to a rapid algorithm for deciding the question, and for constructing the desired permutation when one exists.

It facilitates the retrieval of information from two different relations based on a Cartesian product of the two relations. The join is one of the most diffidult operations to implement efficiently, as no predefined links between relations are required to exist (as they are with network and hierarchical systems). The join is the only relational algebra operation that allows the combining of related tuples from relations on different attribute schemes. Since it is executed frequently and is expensive, much research effort has been applied to the optimization of join processing. In this paper, the different kinds of joins and the various implementation techniques are surveyed. These different methods are classified based on how they partition tuples from different relations. Some require that all tuples from one be compared to all tuples from another; other algorithms only compare some tuples from each. In addition, some techniques perform an explicit partitioning, whereas others are implicit.}}

	Abstract = {Modelling power systems is an area of ongoing interest in the transmission
	 management and control systems community. Continuing development is
	 driven by two forces. The traditional tasks of model maintenance
	 and management must be achieved with fewer resources. At the same
	 time, model exchange and coordination has become a priority. The
	 latter force arises from the disaggregation of utility functions and
	 the introduction of power markets. This paper begins by identifying
	 some of the power system modelling tasks that have become important,
	 but are ill served by current tools and techniques. Among these are
	 model versioning and version control, migration of models between
	 different schema, the transformation of models for different purposes
	 or applications, and the merging of models from different sources.
	 These tasks are typically handled by semi-manual methods or heavily
	 customized software. The paper then describes the application of
	 knowledge representation to power system modelling. In particular, the
	 power of this approach to provide generic solutions to the foregoing
	 problems is explored. Knowledge representation is contrasted with
	 more common data representations and put into context with current
	 industry initiatives, EPRI CIM, UMS DAF and XML/CIM. Finally, the
	 feasibility of using knowledge representation for power system models is
	 illustrated with a case study from a major Australian distribution utility.}}

	Abstract = {XML documents are normally stored as plain text files. Hence,
	 the natural and most convenient way to update XML documents is to
	 simply edit the text files. But efficient query evaluation algorithms
	 require XML documents to be in- dexed. Every element is given a unique
	 identifier based on its location in the document or its preorder-traversal
	 order, and this identifier is later used as (part of) the key in the
	 index. Reassigning orders of possibly a large number of elements is
	 therefore necessary when the original XML documents are updated.
	 Immutable dynamic labeling schemes have been proposed to solve this
	 problem, that, however, require very long labels and may decrease query
	 performance. If we con- sider a real-world scenario, we note that many
	 relatively small ad-hoc XML segments are inserted/deleted into/from an
	 existing XML database. In this paper, we start from this consideration
	 and we propose a new lazy approach to handle XML updates that also
	 improves query performance. The lazy approach: (i) completely avoids
	 reassigning existing el- ement orders after updates; (ii) improves
	 query processing by taking advantages from segments. Experimental
	 results show that our approach is much more efficient in handling
	 updates than using immutable labeling and, at the same time, it also
	 improves the performance of recently defined structural join algorithms.}}

	 demonstrate that lazy evaluation preserves the semantics of XSLT, we reduce

This paper develops a data structure which may be used to test a matrix for the consecutive ones property, and produce the desired permutation of the rows, in linear time. One application of the consecutive ones property is in recognizing interval graphs. A graph is an interval graph if there exists a 1-1 correspondence between its vertices and a set of intervals on the real line such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding intervals have a nonempty intersection. Fulkerson and Gross have characterized interval graphs as those for which the clique versus vertex incidence matrix has the consecutive ones property. In testing this particular matrix for the consecutive ones property we may process the columns in a special order to simplify the algorithm. This yields the interval graph recognition algorithm which is presented in section 2; section 3 indicates how this algorithm may be extended to the general consecutive ones problem.}}

exists a one-to-one mapping of the vertices of G1 onto the vertices of
G2 such that two vertices of G1 are adjacent if and only if their
images in G2 are adjacent. In addition to determining the existence of
such an isomorphism, it is useful to be able to produce an
isomorphism-inducing mapping in the case where one exists. The
isomorphism problem for triconnected planar graphs is particularly
simple since a triconnected planar graph has a unique embedding on a
sphere [6]. Weinberg [5] exploited this fact in developing an
algorithm for testing isomorphism of triconnected planar graphs in
O(|V|2) time where V is the set consisting of the vertices of both
graphs. The result has been extended to arbitrary planar graphs and
improved to O(|V|log|V|) steps by Hopcroft and Tarjan [2,3]. In this
paper, the time bound for planar graph isomorphism is improved to
O(|V|). In addition to determining the isomorphism of two planar
graphs, the algorithm can be easily extended to partition a set of
planar graphs into equivalence classes of isomorphic graphs in time
linear in the total number of vertices in all graphs in the set. A
random access model of computation (see Cook [1]) is assumed. Although
the proposed algorithm has a linear asymptotic growth rate, at the
present stage of development it appears to be inefficient on account
of a rather large constant. This paper is intended only to establish
the existence of a linear algorithm which subsequent work might make
truly efficient.

	Abstract = {Tree patterns form a natural
	 basis to query tree-structured data such as XML and LDAP. Since the
	 efficiency of tree pattern matching against a tree-structured database
	 depends on the size of the pattern, it is essential to identify and
	 eliminate redundant nodes in the pattern and do so as quickly as
	 possible. In this paper, we study tree pattern minimization both in the
	 absence and in the presence of integrity constraints (ICs) on the
	 underlying tree-structured database. When no ICs are considered, we
	 call the process of minizing a tree pattern, constraint-independent
	 minimization. We develop a polynomial time algorithm called CIM for this
	 purpose. CIM's efficiency stems from two key properties: (i) a node
	 cannot be redundant unless its children are, and (ii) the order of
	 elimination of redundant nodes is immaterial. When ICs are considered for
	 minimization, we refer to it as constraint-dependent minimization.
	 For tree-structured databases, required child/descendant andd type
	 co-occurrence ICs are very natural. Under such ICs, we show that the
	 minimal equivalent query is unique. We show the surprising result
	 that the algorithm obtained by first augmenting the tree pattern
	 using ICs, and then applying CIM, always finds the unique minimal
	 equivalent query; we refer to this algorithm as ACIM. While ACIM is
	 also polynomial time, it can be expensive in practice because of its
	 inherent non-locality. We then present a fast algorithm, CDM, that
	 identifies and eliminates local redundancies due to ICs, based on
	 propagating "information labels" up the tree pattern. CDM can be
	 applied prior to ACIM for improving the minimization efficiency. We
	 complement our analytical results with an experimental study that
	 shows the effectiveness of our tree pattern minimization techniques.}}

The presentation will distinguish a semantic web markup format rather than a format intended solely for software as one intended to be easier for end users to author and more clearly be appropriate for typical application areas of lightweight web metadata and authored web ontologies.

XML best practice in any area is a tricky subject to discuss and get agreement on but the XML technologies considered include XML Namespaces, XML QNames in content, omitting some darker corners of the XML specification along with use of clear user-friendly technologies such as the RELAXNG grammar-based XML schema language, part of the ISO DSDL work.

We show that this simple language is equivalent to monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for Web information extraction and propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and comparing wrappers. Along the way, several other results on the complexity of query evaluation and query containment for monadic datalog over trees are established, and a simple normal form for this language is presented. Using the above results, we subsequently study the kernel fragment Elog- of the Elog wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator). Curiously, Elog- exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed, programs in this language can be entirely visually specified.}}

This paper describes the main features, key contributions, and lessons learned while implementing such a system. Its architecture consists of (i) a range-based encoding of XML documents into relational tables, (ii) a compilation technique that translates XQuery into a basic relational algebra, (iii) a restricted (order) property-aware peephole relational query optimization strategy, and (iv) a mapping from XML update statements into relational updates. Thus, this system implements all essential XML database functionalities (rather than a single feature) such that we can learn from the full consequences of our architectural decisions. While implementing this system, we had to extend the state-of-the-art with a number of new technical contributions, such as loop-lifted staircase join and efficient relational query evaluation strategies for XQuery theta-joins with existential semantics. These contributions as well as the architectural lessons learned are also deemed valuable for other relational back-end engines. The performance and scalability of the resulting system is evaluated on the XMark benchmark up to data sizes of 11GB. The performance section also provides an extensive benchmark comparison of all major XMark results published previously, which confirm that the goal of purely relational XQuery processing, namely speed and scalability, was met.}}

	Abstract = {A core set of efficient access methods is central to the development of
	 any database system. In the context of an XML database, there has
	 been considerable effort devoted to defining a good set of primitive
	 operators and inventing efficient access methods for each individual
	 operator. These primitive operators have been defined either at the
	 macro-level (using a "pattern tree" to specify a selection, for example)
	 or at the micro-level (using multiple explicit containment joins
	 to instantiate a single XPath expression).In this paper we argue
	 that it is valuable to consider operations at each level. We do this
	 through a study of operator merging: the development of a new access
	 method to implement a combination of two or more primitive operators.
	 It is frequently the case that access methods for merged operators
	 are superior to a pipelined execution of separate access methods
	 for each operator. We show operator merging to be valuable at both
	 the micro-level and the macro-level. Furthermore, we show that the
	 corresponding merged operators are hard to reason with at the other
	 level.Specifically, we consider the influence of projections and set
	 operations on pattern-based selections and containment joins. We show,
	 through both analysis and extensive experimentation, the benefits of
	 considering these operations all together. Even though our experimental
	 verification is only with a native XML database, we have reason to believe
	 that our results apply equally to RDBMS-based XML query engines.}}

Consequently, at the level of the con- ceptual database, duplicates in base relations or in views are not allowed, nor are operations on mul- tirelations. Multirelations as query output can be specified by designating a subset of some relation's columns for output, while "hiding" the rest of the columns. Similarly, aggregate functions are applied to multirelations by applying them to a column within a relation. Our approach can be applied to extend any query language in a consistent way to have full multirelational expressiveness, and such an extension for the query language QUEL is detailed.}}

We describe a progression of sublanguages in this paradigm that (1) have increasing expressive power, and (2) illustrate robust conceptual restrictions thus exhibiting interesting additional properties. These properties suggest that we consider our sublanguages as candidates for ``query languages''. Viewing query languages as restrictions of our more general programming language has several advantages. First, there is no ``impedance mismatch'' problem; the query languages are already there, so they share common semantic foundation with the general language. Second, we suggest a uniform characterization of nested relational and complex-object algebras in terms of some surprisingly simple operators; and we can make comparisons of expressiveness in a general framework. Third, we exhibit differences in expressive power that are not always based on complexity arguments, but use the idea that a query in one language may not be polymorphically expressible in another. Fourth, ideas of category theory can be profitably used to organize semantics and syntax, in particular our minimal (core) language is a well-understood categorical construction: a cartesian category with a strong monad on it. Finally, we bring out an algebraic perspective, that is, our languages come with equational theories, and categorical ideas can be used to derive a number of rather general identities that may serve as optimizations or as techniques for discovering optimizations.}}

Our main contribution is the operational part of the data model, the query language IQL, which uses oids for three critical purposes: (1) to represent data-structures with sharing and cycles, (2) to manipulate sets, and (3) to express any computable database query. IQL can be type checked, can be evaluated bottom-up, and naturally generalizes most popular rule-based languages. The model can also be extended to incorporate type inheritance, without changes to IQL. Finally, we investigate an analogous value-based data model, whose structural part is founded on regular infinte trees and whose operational part is IQL.}}

	Abstract = {Searching for all occurrences of a twig pattern in
	 an XML document is an important operation in XML query processing.
	 Recently a holistic method TwigStack. [2] has been proposed. The
	 method avoids generating large intermediate results which do not
	 contribute to the final answer and is CPU and I/O optimal when twig
	 patterns only have ancestor-descendant relationships. Another important
	 direction of XML query processing is to build structural indexes
	 [3][8][13][15] over XML documents to avoid unnecessary scanning of
	 source documents. We regard XML structural indexing as a technique to
	 partition XML documents and call it streaming scheme in our paper.
	 In this paper we develop a method to perform holistic twig pattern
	 matching on XML documents partitioned using various streaming schemes.
	 Our method avoids unnecessary scanning of irrelevant portion of XML
	 documents. More importantly, depending on different streaming schemes
	 used, it can process a large class of twig patterns consisting of
	 both ancestor-descendant and parent-child relationships and avoid
	 generating redundant intermediate results. Our experiments demonstrate
	 the applicability and the performance advantages of our approach.}}

Algorithms for containment and equivalence of such ``inequality queries'' are given, under the assumption that the data domains are dense and totally ordered. In general, containment does not imply the existence of homomorphisms (containment mappings), but the homomorphism property does exist for subclasses of inequality queries. A minimization algorithm is defined using the equivalence algorithm. It is first shown that the constants appearing in a query can be divided into ``essential'' and ``nonessential'' subgroups. The minimum query can be nondeterministically guessed using only the essential constants of the original query.}}

	 over XML streams has sparked much interest in the past two years, A
	 number of algorithms have been proposed, supporting wider fragments of
	 the query language, and exhibiting better performance and memory
	 utilization. Nevertheless, all the algorithms known to date use a
	 prohibitively large amount of memory for certain types of queries. A natural
	 question then is whether this memory bottleneck is inherent or just
	 an artifact of the proposed algorithms.In this paper we initiate
	 the first systematic and theoretical study of lower bounds on the
	 amount of memory required to evaluate XPath queries over XML streams.
	 We present a general lower bound technique, which given a query,
	 specifies the minimum amount of memory that any algorithm evaluating the
	 query on a stream would need to incur. The lower bounds are stated in
	 terms of new graph-theoretic properties of queries. The proof is
	 based on tools from communication complexity.We then exploit insights
	 learned from the lower bounds to obtain a new algorithm for XPath
	 evaluation on streams. The algorithm uses space close to the optimum. Our
	 algorithm deviates from the standard paradigm of using automata or
	 transducers, thereby avoiding the need to store large transition tables.}}

An XPath expression defines a way of navigating an XML tree and returns the set of nodes which are reachable from one or more starting nodes through the paths specied by the expression. The prob- lem of efficiently answering XPath queries is very interesting and has recently received in- creasing attention by the research community. In particular, an increasing effort has been devoted to dene effective optimization tech- niques for XPath queries. One of the main issues related to the optimization of XPath queries is their minimization. The minimiza- tion of XPath queries has been studied for lim- ited fragments of XPath, containing only the descendent, the child and the branch opera- tors. In this work, we address the problem of minimizing XPath queries for a more general fragment, containing also the wildcard oper- ator. We characterize the complexity of the minimization of XPath queries, stating that it is NP-hard, and propose an algorithm for computing minimum XPath queries. More- over, we identify an interesting tractable case and propose an ad hoc algorithm handling the minimization of this kind of queries in poly- nomial time.}}

	Abstract = {We represent a set of possible worlds using an incomplete information database. The representation techniques that we study form a hierarchy, which generalizes relations of constants. This hierarchy ranges from the very simple Codd-table, (i e , a relation of constants and distinct variables called nulls, which stand for values present but unknown), to much more complex mechanisms involving views on conditioned-tables, (i e , queries on Codd-tables together with conditions). The views we consider are the queries that have polynomial data-complexity on complete information databases. Our conditions are conjunctions of equalities and inequalities. (1) We provide matching upper and lower bounds on the data-complexity of testing containement, membership, and uniqueness for sets of possible worlds and we fully classify these problems with respect to our representation hierarchy. The most surprising result in this classification is that it is complete in &Pgr;2p, whether a set of possible worlds represented by a Codd-table is a subset of a set of possible worlds represented by a Codd-table with one conjuction of inequalities. (2) We investigate the data-complexity of querying incomplete information databases. We examine both asking for certain facts and for possible facts. Our approach is algebraic but our bounds also apply to logical databases. We show that asking for a certain fact is coNP-complete, even for a fixed first order query on a Codd-table. We thus strengthen a lower bound of [16], who showed that this holds for a Codd-table with a conjunction of inequalities. For each fixed positive existential query we present a polynomial algorithm solving the bounded possible fact problem of this query on conditioned-tables. We show that our approach is, in a sense, the best possible, by deriving two NP-completeness lower bounds for the bounded possible fact problem when the fixed query contains either negation or recursion.}}

	 XQuery has to require exponential amounts of working memory and doubly
	 exponential time in the worst case. In this paper we present a property
	 - the lack of a certain form of composition - that virtually all
	 real-world XQueries have and that allows for query evaluation in singly
	 exponential time and polynomial space. Still, we are able to show for an
	 important special case - our nonrecursive XQuery fragment restricted to
	 atomic value equality - that the composition-free language is just as
	 expressive as the language with composition. Thus, under widely-held
	 complexity-theoretic assumptions, the composition-free language is an
	 exponentially less succinct version of the language with composition.}}

	Abstract = { We define the class of conjunctive queries in relational data bases, and the generalized join operator on relations. The generalized join plays an important part in answering conjunctive queries, and it can be implemented using matrix multiplication. It is shown that while answering conjunctive queries is NP complete (general queries are PSPACE complete), one can find an implementation that is within a constant of optimal. The main lemma used to show this is that each conjunctive query has a unique minimal equivalent query (much like minimal finite automata).

From a given DTD D we show how to derive a number of simple structural constraints which are implied by D. Using a relational abstraction of web databases, we consider a class of conjunctive queries which retrieve elements from web documents stored in a database D. For simplicity, we assume that all documents in D are valid with respect to the same DTDD. The main contribution of the paper is the use of the constraints derived from D to optimise conjunctive queries on D by removing redundant conjuncts. The relational abstraction allows us to show that the constraints derived from a DTD are equivalent to tuple-generating and equality-generating dependencies which hold on D. Having done so, we can use the chase algorithm to show equivalence between a query and its reduced form.}}

	Abstract = {Processing and querying streams,
	 XML streams in particular, has recently become a widely recognized
	 area of interest both in research and in industry. In contrast to
	 traditional query evaluation for databases, where multiple queries
	 against the same data can be evaluated sequentially, for a streamed
	 environment only the simultaneous execution of multiple queries is
	 feasible, as the sequential evaluation requires multiple passes over the
	 stream. This work presents an overview of techniques for optimizing
	 multiple queries posed against a stream of XML data. Building upon the
	 SPEX query engine [Kiesling, Master Thesis, 2002; Olteanu et al.,
	 ICDE, 2003], the problem how to find a cost-optimal query plan that
	 allows the simultaneous evaluation of multiple queries against the
	 same stream is presented and shown to be not only hard to solve but
	 also hard to approximate, if arbitrary parts, and not only common
	 prefixes as in previous approaches, can be shared among query plans.
	 Several heuristics are investigated and compared, in particular with
	 respect to their complexity. Furthermore, it is shown how to extend the
	 SPEX query engine to support such query plans for multiple queries.
	 This extension proves to be both natural and efficient. An extensive
	 experimental evaluation shows that sharing arbitrary operators under a
	 realistic cost function results in query plans that have consistently
	 lower cost for reasonable sets of queries than query plans where
	 only common prefixes are considered. In most cases, the relative
	 improvement is higher than 50%. Although the time for generating such
	 query plans is higher than for query plans where only common prefixes
	 are shared, the increase in time is within an acceptable margin.}}

	Abstract = {XML and XQuery semantics are very sensitive to the order of the produced output. Although pattern-tree based algebraic approaches are becoming more and more popular for evaluating XML, there is no universally accepted technique which can guarantee both a correct output order and a choice of efficient alternative plans.We address the problem using hybrid collections of trees that can be either sets or sequences or something in between. Each such collection is coupled with an Ordering Specification that describes how the trees are sorted (full, partial or no order). This provides us with a formal basis for developing a query plan having parts that maintain no order and parts with partial or full order.It turns out that duplicate elimination introduces some of the same issues as order maintenance: it is expensive and a single collection type does not always provide all the flexibility required to optimize this properly. To solve this problem we associate with each hybrid collection a Duplicate Specification that describes the presence or absence of duplicate elements in it. We show how to extend an existing bulk tree algebra, TLC [12], to use Ordering and Duplicate specifications and produce correctly ordered results. We also suggest some optimizations enabled by the flexibility of our approach, and experimentally demonstrate the performance increase due to them.}}

PC-trees were originally introduced in a planarity test of Shih and Hsu where they represent partial embeddings of planar graphs. PQ-trees were invented by Booth and Lueker to test the consecutive ones property in matrices. The original implementation of the PQ-tree algorithms by Booth and Lueker using nine templates in each bottom-up iteration is rather complicated. Also the complexity analysis is rather intricate. We give a very simple PC-tree algorithm with the following advantages: (1) it does not use any template; (2) it does all necessary operations at each iteration in one batch and does not involve the cumbersome bottom-up operation. PC-trees can be used naturally to test the circular ones property in matrices. And the induced PQ-tree algorithm can considerably simplify Booth and Lueker's modification of Lempel, Even and Cederbaum's planarity test.}}

These challenges arise in enterprise and government data management, digital libraries, "smart" homes and personal information management. We have proposed dataspaces as a data management abstraction for these diverse applications and DataSpace Support Platforms (DSSPs) as systems that should be built to provide the required services over dataspaces. Unlike data integration systems, DSSPs do not require full semantic integration of the sources in order to provide useful services. This paper lays out specific technical challenges to realizing DSSPs and ties them to existing work in our field. We focus on query answering in DSSPs, the DSSP's ability to introspect on its content, and the use of human attention to enhance the semantic relationships in a dataspace.},

	 allows holistic processing of a twig pattern without breaking the twig

	Abstract = {Traditional query optimizers rely
	 on the accuracy of estimated statistics to choose good execution
	 plans. This design often leads to suboptimal plan choices for complex
	 queries, since errors in estimates for intermediate subexpressions
	 grow exponentially in the presence of skewed and correlated data
	 distributions. Re-optimization is a promising technique to cope with such
	 mistakes. Current re-optimizers first use a traditional optimizer
	 to pick a plan, and then react to estimation errors and resulting
	 suboptimalities detected in the plan during execution. The effectiveness of
	 this approach is limited because traditional optimizers choose plans
	 unaware of issues affecting re-optimization. We address this problem
	 using proactive re-optimization, a new approach that incorporates
	 three techniques: (1) the uncertainty in estimates of statistics is
	 computed in the form of bounding boxes around these estimates, (2) these
	 bounding boxes are used to pick plans that are robust to deviations
	 of actual values from their estimates, (3) accurate measurements
	 of statistics are collected quickly and efficiently during query
	 execution. We present an extensive evaluation of these techniques using

However, in many practical situations the available information is incomplete and the values for some columns are missing. Yet few existing database management systems allow the user to enter null values in the database. This monograph analyses the problems raised by allowing null values in relational databases. The analysis covers semantical, syntactical, and computational aspects. Algorithms for query evaluation, dependency enforcement and updates in the presence of null values are also given. The analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithms suggests that from a practical point of view the database should be stored as Horn tables, which are generalizations of ordinary relations, allowing null values and Horn clause-like restrictions on these null values. Horn tables efficiently support a large class of queries, dependencies and updates.}}

The problem is to decide whether a given query Q is feasible, i.e., equivalent to an executable query Q' that observes the limited access patterns given by the sources. We characterize the complexity of deciding feasibility for the classes CQ[not] (conjunctive queries with negation) and UCQ[not] (unions of CQ[not] queries): Testing feasibility is just as hard as testing containment and therefore Pi[p]2-complete. We also provide a uniform treatment for CQ, UCQ, CQ[not], and UCQ[not] by devising a single algorithm which is optimal for each of these classes. In addition, we show how one can often avoid the worst-case complexity by certain approximations: At compile-time, even if a query Q is not feasible, we can find efficiently the minimal executable query containing Q. For query answering at runtime, we devise an algorithm which may report complete answers even in the case of infeasible plans and which can indicate to the user the degree of completeness for certain incomplete answers.}}

The basic computational mechanism is a pattern matching process (``unification'') operating on general record structures (``terms'' of logic). We briefly review the language and compare it especially with pure Lisp. The remainder of the paper discusses techniques for implementing Prolog efficiently; in particular we describe how to compile the patterns involved in the matching process. These techniques are as incorporated in our DECsystem-10 Prolog compiler (written in Prolog). The code it generates is comparable in speed with that produced by existing DEC10 Lisp compilers. We argue that pattern matching is a better method for expressing operations on structured data than conventional selectors and constructors - both for the user and for the implementor.}}

	Abstract = {Database management systems will continue to manage large data volumes. Thus, efficient algorithms for accessing and manipulating large sets and sequences will be required to provide acceptable performance. The advent of object-oriented and extensible database systems will not solve this problem. On the contrary, modern data models exacerbate the problem: In order to manipulate large sets of complex objects as efficiently as today's database systems manipulate simple records, query-processing algorithms and software will become more complex, and a solid understanding of algorithm and architectural issues is essential for the designer of database management software. This survey provides a foundation for the design and implementation of query execution facilities in new database management systems. It describes a wide array of practical query evaluation techniques for both relational and postrelational database systems, including iterative execution of complex query evaluation plans, the duality of sort- and hash-based set-matching algorithms, types of parallel query execution and their implementation, and special operators for emerging database application domains.}}

We generalize the notions of acyclicity and bounded tree-width from conjunctive queries to arbitrary first-order formulas in a straightforward way and analyze the complexity of evaluating formulas of these fragments. Moreover, we show that the acyclic and bounded tree-width fragments have the same expressive power as the well-known guarded fragment and the finite-variable fragments of first-order logic, respectively.}}

	Abstract = {While the information published in the form of XML-compliant documents keeps fast mounting up, efficient and effective query processing and optimization for XML have now become more important than ever. This article reports our recent advances in XML structured-document query optimization. In this article, we elaborate on a novel approach and the techniques developed for XML query optimization. Our approach performs heuristic-based algebraic transformations on XPath queries, represented as PAT algebraic expressions, to achieve query optimization. This article first presents a comprehensive set of general equivalences with regard to XML documents and XML queries. Based on these equivalences, we developed a large set of deterministic algebraic transformation rules for XML query optimization. Our approach is unique, in that it performs exclusively deterministic transformations on queries for fast optimization. The deterministic nature of the proposed approach straightforwardly renders high optimization efficiency and simplicity in implementation. Our approach is a logical-level one, which is independent of any particular storage model. Therefore, the optimizers developed based on our approach can be easily adapted to a broad range of XML data/information servers to achieve fast query optimization. Experimental study confirms the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.}}

	 stream. In our framework, a server may disseminate XML fragments from
	 multiple documents in the same stream, can repeat or replace fragments,
	 and can introduce new fragments or delete invalid ones. A client
	 uses a light-weight database based on our proposed XML algebra to
	 cache stream data and to evaluate XML queries against these data. The
	 synchronization between clients and servers is achieved through annotations
	 and punctuations transmitted along with the data streams. We are
	 presenting a framework for processing XML queries in XQuery form
	 over continuous XML streams. Our framework is based on a novel XML
	 algebra and a new algebraic optimization framework based on query
	 decorrelation, which is essential for non-blocking stream processing.}}

	Abstract = {Query processing using views is the problem of
	 computing the answer to a query based on a set of materialized views,
	 rather than on the raw data in the database. The problem comes in
	 two different forms, called query rewriting and query answering,
	 respectively. In the first form, we are given a query and a set of view
	 definitions, and the goal is to reformulate the query into an expression
	 that refers only to the views. In the second form, besides the query
	 and the view definitions, we are also given the extensions of the
	 views and a tuple, and the goal is to check whether the knowledge on
	 the view extensions logically implies that the tuple satisfies the
	 query. In this paper we address the problem of query processing using
	 views in the context of semistructured data, in particular for the
	 case of regular path queries extended with the inverse operator.
	 Several authors point out that the inverse operator is one of the
	 fundamental extensions for making regular path queries useful in real
	 settings. We present a novel technique based on the use of two-way finite
	 automata. Our approach demonstrates the power of this kind of automata in
	 dealing with the inverse operator, allowing us to show that both query
	 rewriting and query answering with the inverse operator has the same
	 computational complexity as for the case of standard regular path queries.}}

	 languages is needed for solving the challenges posed by the changing
	 Web: We call versatile those query languages able to cope with both
	 Web and Semantic Web data expressed in any (Web or Semantic Web)
	 markup language. This article further suggests that (well-known)
	 referential transparency and (novel) answer-closedness are essential
	 features of versatile query languages. Indeed, they allow queries to be
	 considered like forms and answers like form-fillings in the spirit of the
	 ?query-by-example? paradigm. This article finally suggests that the
	 decentralized and heterogeneous nature of the Web requires incomplete
	 data specifications (or ?incomplete queries?) and incomplete data
	 selections (or ?incomplete answers?): the form-like query can be
	 specified without precise knowledge of the queried data and answers
	 can be restricted to contain only an excerpt of the queried data.}}

The formal grammar for the syntax is annotated with actions generating triples of the RDF graph as defined in RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax. The triples are written using the N-Triples RDF graph serializing format which enables more precise recording of the mapping in a machine processable form. The mappings are recorded as tests cases, gathered and published in RDF Test Cases.}}

	Abstract = {Reachability and distance queries in graphs are fundamental to
	 numerous applications, ranging from geographic navigation systems to
	 Internet routing. Some of these applications involve huge graphs and
	 yet require fast query answering. We propose a new data structure
	 for representing all distances in a graph. The data structure is
	 distributed in the sense that it may be viewed as assigning labels to the
	 vertices, such that a query involving vertices u and v may be answered
	 using only the labels of u and v.Our labels are based on 2-hop covers
	 of the shortest paths, or of all paths, in a graph. For shortest
	 paths, such a cover is a collection S of shortest paths such that for
	 every two vertices u and v, there is a shortest path from u to v that
	 is a concatenation of two paths from S. We describe an efficient
	 algorithm for finding an almost optimal 2-hop cover of a given collection
	 of paths. Our approach is general and can be applied to directed
	 or undirected graphs, exact or approximate shortest paths, or to
	 reachability queries.We study the proposed data structure using a
	 combination of theoretical and experimental means. We implemented our
	 algorithm and checked the size of the resulting data structure on several
	 real-life networks from different application areas. Our experiments
	 show that the total size of the labels is typically not much larger
	 than the network itself, and is usually considerably smaller than an
	 explicit representation of the transitive closure of the network.}}

prove a completeness theorem which guarantees that under certain con-

Moreover, we identify conditions when this algorithm achieves optimal
complexity bounds. We solve the reformulation problem for constraints
by exploiting a reduction to the problem of query reformulation.}}

Presently, a broader class of data base applications like office information systems is considered where this restriction is not convenient. Therefore, an extension of the relational model is proposed consisting of Non First Normal Form (NF2) relations. The relational algebra is enriched mainly by so called nest and unnest operations which transform between NF2 relations and the usual ones. We state some properties of these operations and some rules which occur in combination with the operations of the usual relational algebra. Since we propose to use the NF2 model also for the internal data model these rules are important not only for theoretical reasons but also for a practical implementation.}}

	Abstract = {Not all queries in relational calculus can be answered sensibly when disjunction, negation, and universal quantification are allowed. The class of relation calculus queries or formulas that have sensible answers is called the domain independent class which is known to be undecidable. Subsequent research has focused on identifying large decidable subclasses of domain independent formulas. In this paper we investigate the properties of two such classes: the evaluable formulas and the allowed formulas. Although both classes have been defined before, we give simplified definitions, present short proofs of their main properties, and describe a method to incorporate equality. Although evaluable queries have sensible answers, it is not straightforward to compute them efficiently or correctly. We introduce relational algebra normal form for formulas from which form the correct translation into relational algebra is trivial. We give algorithms to transform an evaluable formula into an equivalent allowed formula and from there into relational algebra normal form. Our algorithms avoid use of the so-called Dom relation, consisting of all constants appearing in the database or the query. Finally, we describe a restriction under which every domain independent formula is evaluable and argue that the class of evaluable formulas is the largest decidable subclass of the domain independent formulas that can be efficiently recognized.}}

	Abstract = {The widespread adoption of XML holds out the promise that document structure can be
	 exploited to specify precise database queries. However, the user may
	 have only a limited knowledge of the XML structure, and hence may
	 be unable to create a correct XQuery, particularly in the context
	 of a heterogeneous information collection. The default is to use
	 keyword-based search and we are all too familiar with how difficult
	 it is to obtain precise answers by these means. We seek to address
	 these problems by introducing the notion of Meaningful Lowest Common
	 Ancestor Structure (MLCAS) for finding related nodes within an XML
	 document. By automatically computing MLCAS and expanding ambiguous
	 tag names, we add new functionalities to XQuery and enable users to
	 take full advantage of XQuery in querying XML data precisely and
	 efficiently without requiring (perfect) knowledge of the document
	 structure. Such a Schema-Free XQuery is potentially of value not just in
	 casual users with partial knowledge of schema, but also in a data
	 integration or data evolution context where one would like a query
	 written once to apply ?forever? as the schema of the data source
	 changes. Our experimental evalua- tion found that it was possible
	 to express a wide variety of queries in a Schema-Free manner and
	 have them return correct results over a broad diversity of schemas.
	 Furthermore, the evaluation of a Schema-Free query is not expensive using a
	 novel stack-based algorithm we develop for computing MLCAS: from 1
	 to 4 times the execution time of an equivalent schema-aware query.}}

This work gives insight into mechanisms for traversal and selection. We compare SYB and XSLT. We approximate XPath in SYB. We make a case for SYB's programmability, when compared to XPath's fixed combinators. We allude to strengthened type checking for SYB traversals so as to reject certain, trivial behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Structurally recursive XML queries are an important query class that follows the
	 structure of XML data. At present, it is difficult for XQuery to type
	 and optimize structurally recursive queries because of polymorphic
	 recursive functions involved in the queries. In this paper, we propose
	 a new technique called structural function inlining which inlines
	 recursive functions used in a query by making good use of available type
	 information. Based on the technique, we develop a new approach to typing and
	 optimizing structurally recursive queries. The new approach yields
	 a more precise result type for a query. Furthermore, it produces
	 an optimal algebraic expression for the query with respect to the
	 type information. When a structurally recursive query is applied to
	 non-recursive XML data, our approach translates the query into a
	 finitely nested iterations. We conducted several experiments with
	 commonly used real-life and synthetic datasets. The experimental
	 results show that the number of node lookups by our approach is on the
	 average 3.7 times and up to 279.8 times smaller than that by the XQuery
	 core?s current approach in evaluating structurally recursive queries.}}

	Abstract = {Structural join operations are central to
	 evaluating queries against XML data, and are typically responsible
	 for consuming a lion?s share of the query processing time. Thus,
	 structural join order selection is at the heart of query optimization
	 in an XML database, just as (value-based) join order selection is
	 central to relational query optimization. In this paper, we introduce
	 five algorithms for structural join order optimization for XML tree
	 pattern matching and present an extensive experimental evaluation. Our
	 experiments demonstrate that many relational rules of thumb are no longer
	 appropriate: for instance, using dynamic programming style optimization is
	 not efficient; limiting consideration to left-deep plans usually
	 misses the best solution. Our experiments also show that a Dynamic
	 Programming optimization with Pruning (DPP) algorithm can find the
	 optimal solution, with low cost relative to the traditional Dynamic
	 Programming (DP) algorithm; and an optimization technique that only
	 considers Fully Pipelined (FP) plans can very quickly choose a plan that
	 in most cases is close to optimal. Our recommendation is that DPP
	 should be used in XML query optimizers where query execution time is
	 expected to be significant, and that FP should be used where it is
	 important to find a good (but not necessarily the best) plan quickly.}}

	 The primitive tree structured relationships are parent-child and
	 ancestor-descendant, and finding all occurrences of these relationships in an
	 XML database is a core operation for XML query processing.In this
	 paper, we develop two families of structural join algorithms for this
	 task: tree-merge and stack-tree. The tree-merge algorithms are a
	 natural extension of traditional merge joins and the recently proposed
	 multi-predicate merge joins, while the stack-tree algorithms have no
	 counterpart in traditional relational join processing. We present
	 experimental results on a range of data and queries using the TIMBER
	 native XML query engine built on top of SHORE. We show that while, in
	 some cases, tree-merge algorithms can have performance comparable to
	 stack-tree algorithms, in many cases they are considerably worse.
	 This behavior is explained by analytical results that demonstrate
	 that, on sorted inputs, the stack-tree algorithms have worst-case I/O
	 and CPU complexities linear in the sum of the sizes of inputs and
	 output, while the tree-merge algorithms do not have the same guarantee.}}

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the evaluation of acyclic Boolean conjunctive queries in relational databases. By well-known results of Yannakakis [1981], this problem is solvable in polynomial time; its precise complexity, however, has not been pinpointed so far. We show that the problem of evaluating acyclic Boolean conjunctive queries is complete for LOGCFL, the class of decision problems that are logspace-reducible to a context-free language. Since LOGCFL is contained in AC1 and NC2, the evaluation problem of acyclic Boolean conjunctive queries is highly parallelizable. We present a parallel database algorithm solving this problem with a logarithmic number of parallel join operations. The algorithm is generalized to computing the output of relevant classes of non-Boolean queries. We also show that the acyclic versions of the following well-known database and AI problems are all LOGCFL-complete: The Query Output Tuple problem for conjunctive queries, Conjunctive Query Containment, Clause Subsumption, and Constraint Satisfaction. The LOGCFL-completeness result is extended to the class of queries of bounded treewidth and to other relevant query classes which are more general than the acyclic queries.}}

We prove that both the data complexity and the query complexity of XPath 1.0 fall into lower (highly parallelizable) complexity classes, while the combined complexity is PTime-hard. Subsequently, we study the sources of this hardness and identify a large and practically important fragment of XPath 1.0 for which the combined complexity is LogCFL-complete and, therefore, in the highly parallelizable complexity class NC2. The second problem is the complexity of validating XML documents against various typing schemes like Document Type De nitions (DTDs), XML Schema De nitions (XSDs), and tree automata, both with respect to data and to combined complexity. For data complexity, we prove that validation is in LogSpace and depends crucially on how XML data is represented. For the combined complexity, we show that the complexity ranges from LogSpace to LogCFL, depending on the typing scheme.}}

	Abstract = {We present the Lorel language, designed for querying semistructured data. Semistructured data
	 is becoming more and more prevalent, e.g., in structured documents
	 such as HTML and when performing simple integration of data from
	 multiple sources. Traditional data models and query languages are
	 inappropriate, since semistructured data often is irregular, some data is
	 missing, similar concepts are represented using different types,
	 heterogeneous sets are present, or object structure is not fully known.
	 Lorel is a user-friendly language in the SQL/OQL style for querying
	 such data effectively. For wide applicability, the simple object
	 model underlying Lorel can be viewed as an extension of the ODMG
	 data model and the Lorel language as an extension of OQL. The main
	 novelties of the Lorel language are: (i) the extensive use of coercion to
	 relieve the user from the strict typing of OQL, which is inappropriate
	 for semistructured data; and (ii) powerful path expressions, which
	 permit a flexible form of declarative navigational access and are
	 particularly suitable when the details of the structure are not known to the
	 user. Lorel also includes a declarative update language. Lorel is
	 implemented as the query language of the Lore prototype database
	 management system at Stanford. Information about Lore can be found at
	 http://www-db.stanford.edu/lore. In addition to presenting the Lorel language in full,
	 this paper briefly describes the Lore system and query processor. We
	 also briefly discuss a second implementation of Lorel on top of a
	 conventional object-oriented database management system, the O2 system.}}

We have separated these characteristics into three groups:

Mandatory, the ones the system must satisfy in order to be termed an object-oriented database system. These are complex objects, object identity, encapsulation, types or classes, inheritance, overriding combined with late binding, extensibility, computational completeness, persistence, secondary storage management, concurrency, recovery and an ad hoc query facility.

Optional, the ones that can be added to make the system better, but which are not mandatory. These are multiple inheritance, type checking and inferencing, distribution, design transactions and versions.

Open, the points where the designer can make a number of choices. These are the programming paradigm, the representation system, the type system, and uniformity.
We have taken a position, not so much expecting it to be the final word as to erect a provisional landmark to orient further debate.}}

	Abstract = {Various models and languages for describing and manipulating hierarchically structured data have been proposed. Algebraic, calculus-based, and logic-programming oriented languages have all been considered. This article presents a general model for complex values (i.e., values with hierarchical structures), and languages for it based on the three paradigms. The algebraic language generalizes those presented in the literature; it is shown to be related to the functional style of programming advocated by Backus (1978). The notion of domain independence (from relational databases) is defined, and syntactic restrictions (referred to as safety conditions) on calculus queries are formulated to guarantee domain independence. The main results are: The domain-independent calculus, the safe calculus, the algebra, and the logic-programming oriented language have equivalent expressive power. In particular, recursive queries, such as the transitive closure, can be expressed in each of the languages. For this result, the algebra needs the powerset operation. A more restricted version of safety is presented, such that the restricted safe calculus is equivalent to the algebra without the powerset. The results are extended to the case where arbitrary functions and predicates are used in the languages.}}

	 XML files. TQL substitutes the standard path-based pattern-matching
	 mechanism with a logic-based mechanism, where the programmer specifies
	 the properties of the pieces of data she is trying to extract. As a
	 result, TQL queries are more ?declarative?, or less ?operational?, than
	 queries in comparable languages. This feature makes some queries easier
	 to express, and should allow the adoption of better optimization
	 techniques. Through a set of examples, we show that the range of
	 queries that can be declaratively expressed in TQL is quite wide. The
	 implementation of TQL binding mechanism requires the adoption of
	 non-standard techniques, and some of its aspects are still open.
	 In this paper we implicitly report about the current status of the
	 implementation by writing all queries using the version of TQL that has been
	 implemented, and that can be freely downloaded from //tql.di.unipi.it/tql.}}

	Abstract = {Data streams (e.g., [Koudas and Srivastava, VLDB,
	 2003]) are an emerging technology for data dissemination in cases
	 where the data throughput or size make it unfeasible to rely on the
	 conventional approach based on storing the data before processing it. Areas
	 where data streams are applied include monitoring of scientific data
	 (astronomy, meteorology), control data (traffic, logistics, networks),
	 and financial data (bank transactions). Data streams are a new and
	 promising setting in which many conventional database methods have to
	 be considered anew. Querying XML data streams without storing and
	 without decreasing considerably the data throughput is especially
	 challenging because XML streams convey tree structured data with (possibly)
	 unbounded size and depth. SPEX, initially described in [Olteanu et
	 al., ICDE, 2002], evaluates XPath queries against XML data streams.
	 SPEX is built upon formal frameworks for (1) rewriting XPath queries
	 into equivalent XPath queries without reverse axes [Olteanu et al.,
	 EDBT-XMLDM, 2002] and (2) correct query evaluation with polynomial
	 combined complexity using networks of pushdown transducers [Olteanu
	 et al., SAC, 2004]. Such transducers are simple, independent, and
	 can be connected in a flexible manner, thus allowing not only easy
	 extensions but also extensive query optimization, e.g., by sharing
	 transducers. A reason for the latter is that processing new query constructs
	 implemented by new transducers does not affect the processing of
	 existing ones. As a proof of concept, SPEX is extended here with novel
	 compile-time optimizations that reduce both the size of the transducer
	 network and the processing of irrelevant stream fragments. SPEX is
	 demonstrated using a practically useful application for monitoring processes
	 running on UNIX systems, and a novel, sophisticated visualization
	 of its run-time system, called SPEX Viewer. SPEX Viewer makes it
	 possible to visualize (1) the step-by-step rewriting of XPath queries
	 into equivalent queries without reverse axes, (2) the networks of
	 pushdown transducers generated from such queries, (3) the incremental
	 processing of XML streams with these networks under various novel
	 optimization settings, and (4) the progressive generation of answers.}}

RDF is the W3C standard model for describing the semantics and reasoning about information on the Web. Unfortunately, RDF and XML---although very close to each other---are based on two different paradigms. We argue that in order to lead the Semantic Web to its full potential, the syntax and the semantics of information needs to work together. To this end, we develop a model-theoretic semantics for the XML XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model, which provides a unified model for both XML and RDF. This unified model can serve as the basis for Web applications that deal with both data and semantics. We illustrate the use of this model on a concrete information integration scenario. Our approach enables each side of the fence to benefit from the other, notably, we show how the RDF world can take advantage of XML query languages, and how the XML world can take advantage of the reasoning capabilities available for RDF.}}

	Abstract = {TAX is perhaps the best known extension of the relational algebra to handle
	 queries to XML databases. One problem with TAX (as with many existing
	 relational DBMSs) is that the semantics of terms in a TAX DB are not
	 taken into account when answering queries. Thus, even though TAX
	 answers queries with 100% precision, the recall of TAX is relatively
	 low. Our TOSS system improves the recall of TAX via the concept of a
	 similarity enhanced ontology (SEO). Intuitively, an ontology is a
	 set of graphs describing relationships (such as isa, partof, etc.)
	 between terms in a DB. An SEO also evaluates how similarities between
	 terms (e.g. "J. Ullman", "Jeff Ullman", and "Jeffrey Ullman") affect
	 ontologies. Finally, we show how the algebra proposed in TAX can
	 be extended to take SEOs into account. The result is a system that
	 provides a much higher answer quality than TAX does alone (quality is
	 defined as the square root of the product of precision and recall).
	 We experimentally evaluate the TOSS system on the DBLP and SIGMOD
	 bibliographic databases and show that TOSS has acceptable performance.}}

	Abstract = {In recent years it has been argued that when XML encodings become complex,
	 DOM trees are no longer adequate for query processing. Alternative
	 representations of XML documents, such as multi-colored trees have
	 been proposed as a replacement for DOM trees for complex markup. In
	 this paper we consider the use of Generalized Ordered-Descendant
	 Directed Acyclic Graphs (GODDAGs) for the purpose of storing and
	 querying complex document- centric XML. GODDAGs are designed to store
	 multihierarchical XML markup over the shared PCDATA content. They support
	 representation of overlapping markup, which otherwise cannot be represented
	 easily in DOM. We describe how the semantics of XPath axes can be
	 modified to define path expressions over GODDAG, and enhance it with
	 the facilities to traverse and query overlapping markup. We provide
	 efficient algorithms for axis evaluation over GODDAG and describe the
	 implementation of the query processor based on our definitions and algorithms.}}

	Year = {2001},
	Abstract = {Semistructured data are usually
	 formalized as trees or more generally as graphs. Query languages for
	 semistructured data have been proposed that, like SQL, can be seen as
	 involving a number of variables, but, in contrast to SQL, arrange
	 the variables in trees or graphs reflecting the structure of the
	 semistructured data to be retrieved. Leaving aside the ``construct''
	 parts of queries, answers can be formalized as mappings represented
	 as tuples, hence called answer tuples, that assign database nodes
	 to query variables. These answer tuples underly the semistructured
	 data delivered as answers. A simple enumeration of answer tuples
	 following the old relational approach is problematic for several reasons.
	 First, the number of answer tuples for a query may grow exponentially
	 in the size of both, the query and the database. Second, even if
	 the number of answer tuples is manageable, the frequent sharing of
	 common data between distinct answer tuples is no more apparent in
	 their enumeration. In this article, it is first argued that, in the
	 context of semistructured data, enumerating answer tuples is often
	 inappropriate and that aggregated answers are preferable. Then, a
	 notion of aggregated answers called complete answer aggregate (CAA) is
	 introduced and algorithms for computing CAAs are given. It is shown
	 that CAAs enjoy nice complexity properties: (1) While the number of
	 answer tuples may be exponential in the size of the query, the size of
	 the CAA is at most linear in the size of the query and quadratic
	 in the size of the database; (2) the complexity of computing the
	 CAA of a query depends on the query's structural complexity (i.e.
	 whether it is a sequence, tree, graph, etc.) but is independent of the
	 structural complexity of the database. For tree queries, efficient
	 polynomial algorithms are given. Besides, it is argued that CAAs are
	 particularly appropriate for answer searching and answer browsing.}}

	Abstract = {The WWW Consortium (W3C) has recently presented a working draft of
	 XQuery, which is intended to serve as standardized query language for
	 XML. XQuery and other high-level query languages for XML documents
	 are not yet implemented by commercial products. Yet many browsers
	 have already built-in XSLT support for transforming XML documents.
	 XSLT is a standard way of performing structural rearrangement or
	 presentational transformation of XML documents, but formulating complex
	 queries is, compared to XQuery, difficult and error-prone. If XQuery
	 expressions could be translated into XSLT (e.g. by a translator written in
	 Java or XSLT itself), the benefits of Xquery would be immediately
	 available to a wide range of commercial products. This paper introduces a
	 process for translating queries formulated in XQuery syntax into XSL
	 stylesheets. The process is described independently from a particular
	 implementation by means of an ASM (Abstract State Machine). The ASM
	 traverses the parse tree of a particular query and translates each node
	 into corresponding XSLT commands. The result of this translation
	 process is an XSL stylesheet that can be applied to an XML document in
	 order to perform the given query. The presented ASM can be easily
	 coded in Java or XSLT to implement a prototype XQ2XSL translator.}}

	 Structural summaries, which have been proposed to speedup XML query
	 processing have graph forms as well. The existent approaches for
	 evaluating queries over tree structured data (i.e. data whose underlying
	 structure is a tree) are not directly applicable when the data is
	 modeled as a random graph. Moreover, they cannot be applied when
	 structural summaries are employed and, to the best of our knowledge, no
	 analogous techniques have been reported for this case either. As a
	 result, the potential of structural summaries is not fully exploited.In
	 this paper, we investigate query evaluation techniques applicable
	 to graph-structured data. We propose efficient algorithms for the
	 case of directed acyclic graphs, which appear in many real world
	 situations. We then tailor our approaches to handle other directed
	 graphs as well. Our experimental evaluation reveals the advantages
	 of our solutions over existing methods for graph-structured data.}}

	 languages for semistructured data and XML. We describe a simple and
	 powerful query language based on pattern matching and show that it can
	 be expressed using structural recursion, which is introduced as a
	 top-down, recursive function, similar to the way XSL is defined on XML
	 trees. On cyclic data, structural recursion can be defined in two
	 equivalent ways: as a recursive function which evaluates the data top-down
	 and remembers all its calls to avoid infinite loops, or as a bulk
	 evaluation which processes the entire data in parallel using only
	 traditional relational algebra operators. The latter makes it possible for
	 optimization techniques in relational queries to be applied to structural
	 recursion. We show that the composition of two structural recursion
	 queries can be expressed as a single such query, and this is used as
	 the basis of an optimization method for mediator systems. Several
	 other formal properties are established: structural recursion can be
	 expressed in first-order logic extended with transitive closure; its data
	 complexity is PTIME; and over relational data it is a conservative
	 extension of the relational calculus. The underlying data model is based
	 on value equality, formally defined with bisimulation. Structural
	 recursion is shown to be invariant with respect to value equality.}}

	Abstract = {With the growing importance of XML in data exchange, much research has been

	 index structure for searching XML documents. By representing both
	 XML documents and XML queries in structure-encoded sequences, we
	 show that querying XML data is equivalent to finding subsequence
	 matches. Unlike index methods that disassemble a query into multiple
	 sub-queries, and then join the results of these sub-queries to provide the
	 final answers, ViST uses tree structures as the basic unit of query
	 to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore, ViST provides a
	 unified index on both content and structure of the XML documents, hence
	 it has a performance advantage over methods indexing either just
	 content or structure. ViST supports dynamic index update, and it relies
	 solely on B+ Trees without using any specialized data structures that
	 are not well supported by DBMSs. Our experiments show that ViST is
	 effective, scalable, and efficient in supporting structural queries.}}

	 occurring in documents. Using this intermediate result, queries combining
	 structure and textual references are composed semiautomatically.
	 After query evaluation, the full set of answers is presented in a

	 documents, queries and answers to enable new interactive visualization and
	 exploration techniques that support mixed IR and database-oriented
	 querying, thus bridging the gap between these three views on the
	 data to be retrieved. Another salient characteristic of X2 which
	 distinguishes it from other visual query systems for XML is that
	 it supports various degrees of detailedness in the presentation of

	 retrieved elements once the complete answer set has been computed.}}

	Abstract = {Hypertree width [22, 25] is a measure of the degree of cyclicity of hypergraphs. A number of relevant problems from different areas, e.g., the evaluation of conjunctive queries in database theory or the constraint satisfaction in AI, are tractable when their underlying hypergraphs have bounded hypertree width. However, in practical contexts like the evaluation of database queries, we have more information besides the structure of queries. For instance, we know the number of tuples in relations, the selectivity of attributes and so on. In fact, all commercial query-optimizers are based on quantitative methods and do not care about structural properties.In this paper, we define the notion of weighted hypertree decomposition, in order to combine structural decomposition methods with quantitative approaches. Weighted hypertree decompositions are equipped with cost functions, that can be used for modelling many situations where we have further information on the given problem, besides its hypergraph representation. We analyze the complexity of computing the hypertree decompositions having the smallest weights, called minimal hypertree decompositions. We show that, in many cases, adding weights we loose tractability. However, we prove that, under some - not very severe - restrictions on the allowed cost functions and on the target hypertrees, optimal weighted hypertree decompositions can be computed in polynomial time. For some easier hypertree weighting functions, this problem is also highly parallelizable. Then, we provide a cost function that models query evaluation costs and show how to exploit weighted hypertree decompositions for determining (logical) query plans for answering conjunctive queries. Finally, we present the results of an experimental comparison of this query optimization technique with the query optimization of a commercial DBMS. These preliminary results are very promising, as for some large queries (with many joins) our hybrid technique clearly outperforms the commercial optimizer.}}

	Abstract = {In previous work, towards the integration of rules and ontologies in the
	 SemanticWeb, we have proposed a combination of logic programming under
	 the answer set semantics with the description logics SHIF(D) and
	 SHOIN(D), which underly the Web ontology languages OWL Lite and OWL
	 DL, respectively. More precisely, we have introduced description
	 logic programs (or dl-programs), which consist of a description logic
	 knowledge base L and a nite set of description logic rules P, and we have
	 de ned their answer set semantics. In this paper, we continue this
	 line of research. Here, as a central contribution, we present the
	 well-founded semantics for dl-programs, and we analyze its semantic
	 properties. In particular, we show that it generalizes the well-founded
	 semantics for ordinary normal programs. Furthermore, we show that in
	 the general case, the well-founded semantics of dl-programs is a
	 partial model that approximates the answer set semantics, whereas
	 in the positive and the stratified case, it is a total model that
	 coincides with the answer set semantics. Finally, we also provide
	 complexity results for dl-programs under the well-founded semantics.}}

	Abstract = {XML is emerging as a major standard for

	 have been proposed to manage XML data. In order to assess an XML

	 also been proposed, including XMark and XMach. However, no reported
	 studies using those benchmarks were found that can provide users with
	 insights on the impacts of a variety of storage models on XML query
	 performance. In this article, we report our first set of results on
	 benchmarking a set of XML database implementations using two XML
	 benchmarks. The selected implementations represent a wide range of
	 approaches, including RDBMS-based systems with document-independent and
	 document-dependent XML-relational schema mapping approaches, and XML native
	 engines based on an Object-Oriented Model and the Document Object
	 Model. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to study relative

The main lemma used to show this is that each conjunctive query has a unique minimal equivalent query (much like minimal finite automata).

	Abstract = {Uncertain information is commonplace in real-world data management scenarios. An important challenge in this context is the ability to represent large sets of possible instances (worlds) while sup- porting efficient storage and processing. The recent formalism of world- set decompositions (WSDs) provides a space-efficient representation for uncertain data that also supports scalable processing. WSDs are com- plete for finite world-sets in that they can represent any finite set of possible worlds. For possibly infinite world-sets, we show that a natu- ral generalization of WSDs precisely captures the expressive power of c-tables. We then give evidence that WSDs are a practically more re- alistic representation system for incomplete information than c-tables and other recent representation systems. We show that several impor- tant problems are efficiently solvable on WSDs while they are NP-hard on c-tables. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for factorizing WSDs, i.e. an efficient algorithm for minimizing such representations.

	Abstract = {This thesis investigates querying the Web
	 and the Semantic Web. It proposes a new rulebased query language
	 called Xcerpt. Xcerpt differs from other query languages in that it
	 uses patterns instead of paths for the selection of data, and in
	 that it supports both rule chaining and recursion. Rule chaining
	 serves for structuring large queries, as well as for designing complex
	 query programs (e.g. involving queries to the Semantic Web), and
	 for modelling inference rules. Query patterns may contain special
	 constructs like partial subqueries, optional subqueries, or negated
	 subqueries that account for the particularly flexible structure of data
	 on the Web. Furthermore, this thesis introduces the syntax of the
	 language Xcerpt, which is illustrated on a large collection of use cases
	 both from the conventional Web and the Semantic Web. In addition,
	 a declarative semantics in form of a Tarski-style model theory is
	 described, and an algorithm is proposed that performs a backward chaining
	 evaluation of Xcerpt programs. This algorithm has also been implemented
	 (partly) in a prototypical runtime system. A salient aspect of this
	 algorithm is the specification of a non-standard unification algorithm
	 called simulation unification that supports the new query constructs
	 described above. This unification is symmetric in the sense that
	 variables in both terms can be bound. On the other hand it is in
	 contrast to standard unification assymmetric in the sense that the
	 unification determines that the one term is a subterm of the other term.}}

	 access control. Given an access control policy, query expression,
	 and an optional schema, static analysis determines if this query
	 expression is guaranteed not to access elements or attributes that are
	 permitted by the schema but hidden by the access control policy. Static
	 analysis can be performed without evaluating any query expression
	 against an actual database. Run-time checking is required only when
	 static analysis is unable to determine whether to grant or deny access
	 requests. A nice side-effect of static analysis is query optimization:
	 access-denied expressions in queries can be evaluated to empty lists at
	 compile time. We have built a prototype of static analysis for XQuery,
	 and shown the effectiveness and scalability through experiments.}}

queries as well as a related class of XML integrity constraints (dependencies).We identify a fragment
of XBind for which containment is decidable, in fact p2-complete, and a further fragment for which
containment is NP-complete. We extend the containment algorithm to take XML dependencies into
account. We give an algorithm for the reformulation of XBind queries under combinations of GAV
and LAV XQuery views, as well as additional dependencies.We prove a completeness theorem which
guarantees that under certain conditions, our algorithm will find a minimal reformulation if one exists.
Moreover, we identify conditions when this algorithm achieves optimal complexity bounds. Our
results on containment and reformulation depend on certain restrictions on the query and constraint
languages.We calibrate the results by showing that lifting these restrictions significantly changes the
complexity of the problems.}}

	 to deliver a desired level of document security. We examine this
	 question by describing a real world XML application whose security
	 requirements are more complex than for a simple document transfer
	 between just two parties; proposing a document transfer architecture
	 into which XSLT can be plugged-in; and identifying those features of
	 XSLT which must be applied to meet the application requirements. We
	 conclude that XSLT is only just adequate in the proposed scenario; and
	 then only by making use of its " extension functions " capability.}}

	 it is delivered to the subscriber. Naturally, it is desired that
	 the decision to which subscriber a document must be sent should be
	 taken quickly. Although the test whether a single XPath expression
	 matches can be done in polynomial time, it is not efficient to test

	 partial order on expressions, i.e., for some expressions p; q it might
	 hold that whenever a document matches p it also matches q (denoted
	 p 0 q). If we already know that a document matches p, we do not
	 need to test q anymore, as it matches automatically. Correspond-
	 ingly, if we know that q does not match then p will not match either.
	 Hence, the inclusion structure of the XPath expressions should be
	 computed in advance to decrease online computation time. This leads to
	 the algorithmic problem of XPath Query Containment, i.e., checking
	 whether p 0 q (for a different, index- based approach see, e.g., [6]).}}

	 focus on an important axis relation which is not expressible in XPath
	 1.0 and is very useful in practice: the conditional axis. With it
	 we can express paths specified by for instance ?do a child step,
	 while test is true at the resulting node?. We study the effect of
	 adding conditional axis relations to XPath on its expressive power
	 and the complexity of the query evaluation and query equivalence
	 problems. We define an XPath dialect XCPath which is expressively
	 complete, has a linear time query evaluation algorithm and for which

	 since it is a core component of many XML processing standards such
	 as XSLT or XQuery. In this paper, based on axis symmetry of XPath,
	 equivalences of XPath 1.0 location paths involving ?reverse axes?, such as
	 ancestor and preceding, are established. These equivalences are used
	 as rewriting rules in an algorithm for transforming location paths
	 with reverse axes into equivalent reverse-axis-free ones. Location
	 paths without reverse axes as generated by the presented rewriting
	 algorithm enable efficient SAX-like streamed data processing of XPath.}}

	Abstract = {XML messaging is at the
	 heart of Web services, providing the flexibility required for their
	 deployment, composition, and maintenance. Yet, current approaches to Web
	 services development hide the messaging layer behind Java or C# APIs,
	 preventing the application to get direct access to the underlying XML
	 information. To address this problem, we advocate the use of a native XML
	 language, namely XQuery, as an integral part of the Web services
	 development infrastructure. The main contribution of the paper is a
	 binding between WSDL, the Web Services Description Language, and
	 XQuery. The approach enables the use of XQuery for both Web services
	 deployment and composition. We present a simple command-line tool that can
	 be used to automatically deploy a Web service from a given XQuery
	 module, and extend the XQuery language itself with a statement for
	 accessing one or more Web services. The binding provides tight-coupling
	 between WSDL and XQuery, yielding additional benefits, notably: the
	 ability to use WSDL as an interface language for XQuery, and the
	 ability to perform static typing on XQuery programs that include
	 Web service calls. Last but not least, the proposal requires only
	 minimal changes to the existing infrastructure. We report on our
	 experience implementing this approach in the Galax XQuery processor.}}

	 could be valuable for establishing its success. With this motivation
	 in mind, we designed XQBE, a visual dialect of XQuery inspired by
	 QBE (Query by Example). QBE was initially proposed as alternative
	 to SQL and has gained popularity as the language supported by MS
	 Access, currently presented to users with a very limited experience of
	 query languages. Coherent with the XML data model, XQBE uses one
	 or more hierarchical structures to denote the input XML documents
	 and one structure to denote the output document. Similar to QBE,
	 structures are annotated to express selection predicates; explicit
	 bindings between these structures visualize the input/output mappings.}}

	 closely adheres to the language semantics, e.g., it obeys node identity

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of efficiently producing ranked results for
	 keyword search queries over hyperlinked XML documents. Evaluating
	 keyword search queries over hierarchical XML documents, as opposed to
	 (conceptually) flat HTML documents, introduces many new challenges. First,
	 XML keyword search queries do not always return entire documents,
	 but can return deeply nested XML elements that contain the desired
	 keywords. Second, the nested structure of XML implies that the notion of
	 ranking is no longer at the granularity of a document, but at the
	 granularity of an XML element. Finally, the notion of keyword proximity
	 is more complex in the hierarchical XML data model. In this paper,
	 we present the XRANK system that is designed to handle these novel
	 features of XML keyword search. Our experimental results show that XRANK
	 offers both space and performance benefits when compared with existing
	 approaches. An interesting feature of XRANK is that it naturally
	 generalizes a hyperlink based HTML search engine such as Google.
	 XRANK can thus be used to query a mix of HTML and XML documents.}}

XSLT is designed for use as part of XSL, which is a stylesheet language for XML. In addition to XSLT, XSL includes an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting. XSL specifies the styling of an XML document by using XSLT to describe how the document is transformed into another XML document that uses the formatting vocabulary.

XSLT is also designed to be used independently of XSL. However, XSLT is not intended as a completely general-purpose XML transformation language. Rather it is designed primarily for the kinds of transformations that are needed when XSLT is used as part of XSL.}}

	 of the previous editions of the XSLT Programmer?s Reference, which
	 this book grew from, show that readers appreciate the background
	 material on the design thinking behind the language, the essay on
	 functional programming, the occasional dry wit, the gentle criticism of
	 the language specification when appropriate, and the fact that the

	Abstract = {XSLT plays an important role in data conversions between different XML
	 representations. However, besides the transformations between XML data
	 representations, conversion to an HTML document is one of the most practical
	 tasks for XSLT, because it allows XML documents to be rendered in a
	 human-readable form using Web browsers. We have developed XSLbyDemo,
	 which is an XSLT stylesheet generation module to be plugged into a
	 commercially available full-fledged HTML authoring tool. The remarkable
	 feature of XSLbyDemo is that users can create an XSLT stylesheet
	 automatically solely on the basis of their knowledge of HTML editing. We
	 briefly explain situations where stylesheets for XML rendering are
	 needed. We then introduce the rule generation method based on the
	 users' operation history recorded behind the WYSIWYG editor, and in
	 particular explain the ways of generalizing the created rules so that the
	 obtained rules can be applied to other documents slightly different from
	 the original one. Finally, we give a practical example of the rules
	 generation by XSLbyDemo, and demonstrate that our method can be used for
	 not only the conversion but also the partitioning of a real-life
	 HTML document into smaller pages represented with Compact HTML to
	 be rendered on Web-enabled cellular phones such as i-mode phones}}

	Year = {2004},
	Abstract = {XML is rapidly emerging as a
	 dominant standard for representing and exchanging information. The
	 ability to transform and present data in XML is crucial and XSLT
	 (Extensible stylesheet transformations) is a relatively recent programming
	 language, specially designed to support this activity. Despite its
	 utility, however, XSLT is widely considered a difficult language to
	 learn. In this paper, we present a novel system called XSLTGen, an
	 automatic XSLT Generator. This system automatically generates an XSLT
	 program, given a source XML document and a desired output HTML or XML
	 document. It allows users to become familiar with and learn XSLT
	 programs, based solely on their knowledge of XML or HTML. Our method for
	 automatically generating XSLT transformations is based on the use of semantic
	 mappings between the input and output documents. We show how such
	 mappings can be first discovered and then employed to create XSLT
	 programs. The results of our experiments show that XSLTGen works
	 well with a number of different varieties of XML and HTML documents.}}
