  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSN) generate large volumes of raw data which possess natural heterogeneity. WSNs are normally application specific with no sharing or reusability of sensor data among applications. In order for applications and services to be developed independently of particular WSNs, sensor data need to be enriched with semantic information. In this paper, we propose a semantic Web architecture for sensor networks (SWASN). This information oriented architecture allows the sensor data to be understood and processed in a meaningful way by a variety of applications with different purposes. We develop ontologies for sensor data and use the Jena API for processing which includes querying and inference over sensor data. By studying a building fire emergency scenario, we show that semantic Web technologies can provide high level information extraction and inference of sensor data.},
