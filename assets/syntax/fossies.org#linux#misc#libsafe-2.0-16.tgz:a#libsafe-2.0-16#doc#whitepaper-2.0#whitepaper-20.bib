                 self-replicating program was released upon the
                 Internet. This program (a {\it worm}) invaded VAX and
                 Sun-3 computers running versions of Berkeley UNIX and
                 used their resources to attack still more computers.
                 Within the space of hours this program had spread
                 across the U.S., infecting hundreds or thousands of
                 computers and making many of them unusable due to the
                 burden of its activity. This paper provides a
                 chronology for the outbreak and presents a detailed
                 description of the internals of the worm, based on a C
                 version produced by decompiling.",
