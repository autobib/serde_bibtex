OWL can thus benefit from CASL's strong typing discipline and powerful structuring concepts. Vice versa, the automatic decision procedures available for OWL DL (or more precisely, the underlying description logic SHOIN(D)) become available for a sublanguage of CASL. This is achieved via translations between CASL-DL and SHOIN(D), formalized as so-called institution comorphisms.

CoCASL allows the nested combination of algebraic datatypes and coalgebraic process types.  Moreover, it provides syntactic sugar for an observer-indexed modal logic that allows e.g. expressing fairness properties. This logic includes a generic definition of modal operators for observers with structured equational result types. We prove existence of final models for specifications in a format that allows the use of certain initial datatypes, as well as modal axioms. The use of CoCASL is illustrated by specifications of the process algebras CSP and CCS.},
