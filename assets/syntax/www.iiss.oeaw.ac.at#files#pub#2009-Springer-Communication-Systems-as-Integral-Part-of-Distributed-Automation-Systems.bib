  abstract = {Distributed automation is unthinkable without adequate communication.
	This fact has been discovered quite early, and from the first ideas
	of computer integrated manufacturing onwards, the need for networks
	in automation has been addressed. This article reviews the history
	of fieldbus systems, the problems of standardization, and shed light
	on the complex variety of existing approaches. Furthermore, it will
	discuss the recent adoption of Internet technologies and Ethernet
	as automation network and the ongoing work to overcome its real-time
	limitations. Finally, we address evolution prospects and current
	research issues ranging from the apparent security problem and synchronization
	mechanisms in distributed systems to entirely new approaches like
	bionics-inspired concepts.},
