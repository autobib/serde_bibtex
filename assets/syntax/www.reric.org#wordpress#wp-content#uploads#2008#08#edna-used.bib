  abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces extracellular DNA which functions
	as a cell-to-cell interconnecting matrix component in biofilms. Comparison
	of extracellular DNA and chromosomal DNA by the use of polymerase
	chain reaction and Southern analysis suggested that the extracellular
	DNA is similar to whole-genome DNA. Evidence that the extracellular
	DNA in P. aeruginosa biofilms and cultures is generated via lysis
	of a subpopulation of the bacteria was obtained through experiments
	where extracellular beta-galactosidase released from lacZ-containing
	P. aeruginosa strains was assessed. Experiments with the wild type
	and laslrhll, pqsA, pqsL and fliMpilA mutants indicated that the
	extracellular DNA is generated via a mechanism which is dependent
	on acyl homoserine lactone and Pseudomonas quinolone signalling,
	as well as on flagella and type IV pili. Microscopic investigation
	of flow chamber-grown wild-type P. aeruginosa biofilms stained with
	different DNA stains suggested that the extracellular DNA is located
	primarily in the stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures,
	with a high concentration especially in the outer part of the stalks
	forming a border between the stalk-forming bacteria and the cap-forming
	bacteria. Biofilms formed by laslrhll, pqsA and fliMpilA mutants
	contained less extracellular DNA than biofilms formed by the wild
	type, and the mutant biofilms were more susceptible to treatment
	with sodium dodecyl sulphate than the wild-type biofilm.},

	in polar sea ice. The two species Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Fragilariopsis
	curta are able to grow and divide below freezing temperature of sea
	water and above average sea water salinity. Here we show that antifreeze
	proteins (AFPs), involved in cold adaptation in several psychrophilic
	organisms, are widespread in the two polar species. The presence
	of AFP genes (afps) as a multigene family indicated the importance
	of this group of genes for the genus Fragilariopsis, possibly contributing
	to its success in sea ice. Protein phylogeny showed the potential
	mobility of afps, which appear to have crossed kingdom and domain
	borders, occurring in Bacteria, diatoms, crustaceans and fungi. Our
	results revealed a broad distribution of AFPs not only in polar organisms
	but also in taxa apparently not related to cold environments, suggesting
	that these proteins may be multifunctional. The relevance of AFPs
	to Fragilariopsis was also shown by gene expression analysis. Under
	stress conditions typical for sea ice, with subzero temperatures
	and high salinities, F. cylindrus and F. curta strongly expressed
	selected afps. An E/G point mutation in the Fragilariopsis AFPs may

  pages = {291--303},
  abstract = {The surfaces of bacteria are highly interactive with their environment.
	Whether the bacterium is Gram-negative or Gram-positive, most surfaces
	are charged at neutral pH because of the ionization of the reactive
	chemical groups which stud them. Since prokaryotes have a high surface
	area-to-volume ratio, this can have surprising ramifications. For
	example, many bacteria can concentrate dilute environmental metals
	on their surfaces and initiate the development of fine-grained minerals.
	In natural environments, it is not unusual to find such bacteria
	closely associated with the minerals which they have helped develop.
	Bacteria can be free-living (planktonic), but in most natural ecosystems
	they prefer to grow on interfaces as biofilms; supposedly to take
	advantage of the nutrient concentrative effect of the interface,
	although there must also be gained some protective value against
	predators and toxic agents. Using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model
	system, we have determined that lipopolysaccharide is important in
	the initial attachment of this Gram-negative bacterium to interfaces
	and that this surface moiety subtly changes during biofilm formation.
	Using this same model system, we have also discovered that there
	is a natural tendency for Gram-negative bacteria to concentrate and
	package periplasmic components into membrane vesicles which bleb-off
	the surface. Since some of these components (e.g., peptidoglycan
	hydrolases) can degrade other surrounding cells, the vesicles could
	be predatory; i.e., a natural system by which neighboring bacteria
	are targeted and lysed, thereby liberating additional nutrients to
	the microbial community. This obviously would be of benefit to vesicle-producing
	bacteria living in biofilms containing mixed microbial populations.},

  journal = {J Bacteriol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {190},
  pages = {7232--7240},
  abstract = {Free extracellular DNA is abundant in many aquatic environments. While
	much of this DNA will be degraded by nucleases secreted by the surrounding
	microbial community, some is available as transforming material that
	can be taken up by naturally competent bacteria. One such species
	is Vibrio cholerae, an autochthonous member of estuarine, riverine,
	and marine habitats and the causative agent of cholera, whose competence
	program is induced after colonization of chitin surfaces. In this
	study, we investigate how Vibrio cholerae's two extracellular nucleases,
	Xds and Dns, influence its natural transformability. We show that
	in the absence of Dns, transformation frequencies are significantly
	higher than in its presence. During growth on a chitin surface, an
	increase in transformation efficiency was found to correspond in
	time with increasing cell density and the repression of dns expression
	by the quorum-sensing regulator HapR. In contrast, at low cell density,
	the absence of HapR relieves dns repression, leading to the degradation
	of free DNA and to the abrogation of the transformation phenotype.
	Thus, as cell density increases, Vibrio cholerae undergoes a switch
	from nuclease-mediated degradation of extracellular DNA to the uptake
	of DNA by bacteria induced to a state of competence by chitin. Taken
	together, these results suggest the following model: nuclease production
	by low-density populations of V. cholerae might foster rapid growth
	by providing a source of nucleotides for the repletion of nucleotide
	pools. In contrast, the termination of nuclease production by static,
	high-density populations allows the uptake of intact DNA and coincides
	with a phase of potential genome diversification.},

	In contrast, extracellular DNA is mainly considered as a remnant
	of lysed cells. Here, we report the formation of extracellular bacterial
	DNA as a spatial structure. An aquatic bacterium, strain F8, was
	isolated, which produced a stable filamentous network of extracellular
	DNA. Different staining and enzymatic techniques confirmed that it
	was DNA. We were able to amplify the 16S rRNA gene from the extracellular
	DNA. Restriction endonuclease cleavage and randomly amplified polymorphic
	DNA analysis of extracellular and genomic DNAs revealed major similarities,
	but also some differences in both sequences. Our data demonstrate
	a new function and relevance for extracellular DNA.},

  abstract = {The concentrations,. production rates and turnover times of the components
	of the dissolved DNA (D-DNA) pool, including viruses, were investigated
	in a depth profile at Stn ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical
	Gyre. A recently developed centrifugal concentration method was used
	to quantify the 3 major components of the D-DNA pool: free or enzymatically-hydrolyzable
	D-DNA (ehD-DNA), D-DNA within viruses and uncharacterized bound D-DNA.
	The production rates of each of these components of the D-DNA pool
	were estimated using a dilution technique and the turnover times
	of each component were calculated. Concentrations of total D-DNA
	and ehD-DNA were approximately 1.2 and 0.6 ng ml(-1), respectively,
	throughout the mixed layer (upper 100 m), and decreased with increasing
	depth to 0.2 and 0.06 ng ml(-1) at 500 m, resulting in ehD-DNA constituting
	27 to 51% of the total D-DNA pool. Concentrations of viruses ranged
	from 0.9 to 1.0 x 10(7) ml(-1) within the mixed layer and also decreased
	with increasing depth to 0.2 x 10(7) ml-1 at 500 m. The average mass
	of DNA per viral genome was estimated at each depth with viral genome
	fingerprinting, and ranged from 62.5 to 69.8 ag DNA per virus. Multiplying
	the concentration of viruses by the average mass of DNA per virus
	at each depth revealed the concentration of D-DNA within viruses,
	which ranged from 0.13 to 0.68 ng ml(-1) and constituted 49 to 63
	% of the total D-DNA pool. There was no measurable concentration
	of uncharacterized bound D-DNA in the depth profile. The production
	rates of ehD-DNA and D-DNA within viruses ranged from 0.10 to 0.41
	and 0.03 to 0.07 ng ml(-1) h(-1), respectively, within the mixed
	layer, but no production of D-DNA could be measured below the mixed
	layer. The calculated turnover times of ehD-DNA ranged from 0.97
	to 6.2 h within the mixed layer and were 3 to 10 times shorter than
	the turnover times of D-DNA within viruses, which ranged from 9.6
	to 24 h. In addition, the amount of phosphorus that was calculated
	to be produced within the ehD-DNA was able to support the biologically
	available phosphorus (BAP) demand, based on previously reported measurements
	of BAP uptake at Stn ALOHA. Using the measured virus production rates,
	viruses were estimated to lyse 3.2 to 16.5 % of the standing stock
	of bacteria at Stn ALOHA h(-1), resulting in the release of ehD-DNA,
	which was estimated as 11 to 35% of the total ehD-DNA production.
	This research supports the hypothesis that individual components
	of the D-DNA pool are cycled at different rates and shows that viruses
	in open-ocean gyre systems may have large impacts on the microbial
	community there, including viral-induced mortality and subsequent
	release of cellular contents to the dissolved organic matter pool.},

  abstract = {The distribution of DNA among bacterioplankton and bacterial isolates
	was determined by flow cytometry of DAPI (4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained
	organisms. Conditions were optimized to minimize error from nonspecific
	staining, AT bias, DNA packing, changes in ionic strength, and differences
	in cell permeability. The sensitivity was sufficient to characterize
	the small 1- to 2-Mb-genome organisms in freshwater and seawater,
	as well as low-DNA cells ("dims"). The dims could be formed from
	laboratory cultivars; their apparent DNA content was 0.1 Mb and similar
	to that of many particles in seawater. Preservation with formaldehyde
	stabilized samples until analysis. Further permeabilization with
	Triton X-100 facilitated the penetration of stain into stain-resistant
	lithotrophs. The amount of DNA per cell determined by flow cytometry
	agreed with mean values obtained from spectrophotometric analyses
	of cultures. Correction for the DNA AT bias of the stain was made
	for bacterial isolates with known G+C contents. The number of chromosome
	copies per cell was determined with pure cultures, which allowed
	growth rate analyses based on cell cycle theory. The chromosome ratio
	was empirically related to the rate of growth, and the rate of growth
	was related to nutrient concentration through specific affinity theory
	to obtain a probe for nutrient kinetics. The chromosome size of a
	Marinobacter arcticus isolate was determined to be 3.0 Mb by this
	method. In a typical seawater sample the distribution of bacterial
	DNA revealed two major populations based on DNA content that were
	not necessarily similar to populations determined by using other
	stains or protocols. A mean value of 2.5 fg of DNA cell[-]1 was obtained
	for a typical seawater sample, and 90% of the population contained
	more than 1.1 fg of DNA cell[-]1.},

	DNA would also adsorb to nonpurified mineral materials taken from
	the environment and, particularly, whether adsorbed plasmid DNA would
	be available for natural transformation of bacteria. Therefore, microcosms
	consisting of chemically pure sea sand plus buffered CaCl(2) solution
	were compared with microcosms consisting of material sampled directly
	from a groundwater aquifer (GWA) plus groundwater (GW) with respect
	to the natural transformation of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus by mineral-associated
	DNA. The GWA minerals were mostly sand with inorganic precipitates
	and organic material plus minor quantities of silt and clay (illite
	and kaolinite). The amount of plasmid DNA which adsorbed to GWA (in
	GW) was about 80\% of the amount which adsorbed to purified sand
	(in buffered CaCl(2) solution). Plasmid DNA adsorbed on sand transformed
	A. calcoaceticus significantly less efficiently than did plasmid
	DNA in solution. In contrast, the transformation by sand-adsorbed
	chromosomal DNA was as high as that by DNA in solution. In GWA/GW
	microcosms, the efficiency of transformation by chromosomal DNA was
	similar to that in sand microcosms, whereas plasmid transformation
	was not detectable. However, plasmid transformants were found at
	a low frequency when GWA was loaded with both chromosomal and plasmid
	DNA. Reasons for the low transformation efficiency of plasmid DNA
	adsorbed to mineral surfaces are discussed. Control experiments showed
	that the amounts of plasmid and chromosomal DNA desorbing from sand
	during incubation with a cell-free filtrate of a competent cell suspension
	did not greatly contribute to transformation in sand microcosms,
	suggesting that transformation occurred by direct uptake of DNA from
	the mineral surfaces. Taken together, the observations suggest that

	methods obtain RNA concentration by difference and therefore may
	be biased by DNA estimates. By contrast, the HPLC method provides

	estimated the contribution of the detrital DNA to the total DNA pools

	correlated with values of sediment community oxygen consumption only
	below 100-m depth (dominated by the microbial biomass). These data

	was shown to provide conducive conditions for conjugative gene exchange.
	Concern has been expressed that transfer of recombinant DNA (e.g.
	antibiotic resistance genes) from genetically modified organisms
	(GMOs) such as transgenic plants to phytosphere bacteria may occur
	and thus contribute to the undesirable spread of antibiotic resistance

	sediment transported by sea ice (mostly Out of the narrow zone between
	the landfast ice edge and waters too deep for resuspension and entrainment)
	is at minimum 4 x 10(6) t in the sampling area and is estimated at
	5-8 x 10(6) t over the entire Chukchi and Beaufort shelves in 2001/02,
	representing a significant term in the sediment budget of the western
	Arctic Ocean. Recent changes in the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea ice
	regimes (reduced summer minimum ice extent, ice thinning, reduction
	in multi-year ice extent, altered drift paths and mid-winter landfast
	ice break-out events) have likely resulted in an increase of sediment-laden
	ice in the area. Apart from contributing substantially to along-
	and across-shelf particulate flow, an increase in the amount of dirty
	ice significantly impacts (sub-)ice algal production and may enhance
	the dispersal of pollutants. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	to occur in the environment, yet direct observations of this phenomenon
	are rare or limited to observations where the mechanism(s) could

	by natural transformation, the first report of this process for any
	natural microbial community. Ten percent of marine bacterial isolates
	examined were transformed by plasmid DNA while 14% were transformed
	by chromosomal DNA. Transformation of mixed marine microbial assemblages
	was observed in 5 of 14 experiments. In every case, acquisition of
	the plasmid by members of the indigenous flora was accompanied by
	modification (probably from genetic rearrangement or methylation)
	that altered its restriction enzyme digestion pattern. Estimation
	of transformation rates in estuarine environments based upon the
	distribution of competency and transformation frequencies in isolates
	and mixed populations ranged from 5 x 10(-4) to 1.5 transformants/1
	day. Extrapolation of these rates to ecosystem scales suggests that

  abstract = {Natural plasmid transformation may be a mechanism for the horizontal
	transfer of non-conjugative plasmids in the marine environment, yet
	there are few marine model systems available for the study of this
	process. Using multimers of IncQ/P4 plasmids and a filter transformation
	assay, we have measured the effects of nutrients, salinity, temperature,
	as well as the development and maintenance of competence for genetic
	transformation in the high frequency of transformation (HFT) marine
	Vibrio strain WJT-1C. Transformation frequency was proportional to
	the amount of DNA used from 0.1 to 1.0 mug DNA and was saturated
	at concentrations greater than 1.0 mug. Competence began in the early-exponential
	phase and reached a maximum at the onset of stationary phase. Once
	attained, competence was maintained in both spent and nutrient-free
	media for at least 10 d. Thus, the establishment and maintenance
	of competence was unique compared to previously described transformation
	systems. Temperatures ranging from 4 to 33-degrees-C had no significant
	effect on the maximal transformation frequency of WJT-1C, but at
	37-degrees-C the transformation frequency was reduced. However, temperature
	did affect the rate of the transformation process. Salinities in
	the range 12 to 50 parts per thousand had no significant effect on
	the transformation frequency but transformation frequencies were
	lower at 6 parts per thousand and 63 parts per thousand. Cells were
	transformed equally well in nutrient-free media or rich media. The
	ability of this marine HFT Vibrio strain to develop competence under
	a wide spectrum of conditions and to maintain the competent state
	indicates that natural plasmid transformation could occur in conditions
	found in tropical and subtropical estuaries.},

	whether genes of a complete genome have been acquired by horizontal
	gene transfer. It is based on the analysis of G+C contents, codon
	usage, amino acid usage, and gene position. When we applied this
	procedure to 17 bacterial complete genomes and seven archaeal ones,
	we found that the percentage of horizontally transferred genes varied
	From 1.5% to 14.5%. Archaea and nonpathogenic bacteria had the highest
	percentages and pathogenic bacteria, except for Mycoplasma genitalium,
	had the lowest. As reported in the literature, we found that informational
	genes were less likely to be transferred than operational genes.
	Most of the horizontally transferred genes were only present in one
	or two lineages. Some of these transferred genes include genes that
	form part of prophages, pathogenecity islands, transposases, integrases,
	recombinases, genes present only in one of the two Helicobacter pylori
	strains, and regions of genes functionally related. All of these

  abstract = {The Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES) included the overwintering
	deployment of a research platform in Franklin Bay (70°N, 126°W) and
	provided a unique seasonal record of bacterial dynamics in a coastal
	region of the Arctic Ocean. Our objectives were (1) to relate seasonal
	bacterial abundance (BA) and production (BP) to physico-chemical
	characteristics and (2) to quantify the annual bacterial carbon flux.
	BA was estimated by epifluorescence microscopy and BP was estimated
	from 3H-leucine and 3H-thymidine assays. Mean BA values for the water
	column ranged from 1.0 (December) to 6.8 × 105 cells mL&#8722;1 (July).
	Integral BP varied from 1 (February) to 80 mg C m&#8722;2 d&#8722;1
	(July). During winter-spring, BP was uncorrelated with chlorophyll
	a (Chl a), but these variables were significantly correlated during
	summer-autumn (r s = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001, N = 38), suggesting that
	BP was subject to bottom-up control by carbon supply. Integrated
	BP data showed three distinct periods: fall-winter, late winter&#8211;late
	spring, and summer. A baseline level of BB and BP was maintained
	throughout late winter&#8211;late spring despite the persistent cold
	and darkness, with irregular fluctuations that may be related to
	hydrodynamic events. During this period, BP rates were correlated
	with colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) but not Chl a (r s BP.CDOM&#8739;Chl
	a = 0.20, p &lt; 0.05, N = 176). Annual BP was estimated as 6 g C
	m&#8722;2 a&#8722;1, implying a total BP of 4.8 × 1010 g C a&#8722;1
	for the Franklin Bay region. These results show that bacterial processes
	continue throughout all seasons and make a large contribution to
	the total biological carbon flux in this coastal arctic ecosystem.},

  abstract = {During summer (January 1991) and winter (April 1992) cruises to the
	southern Weddell Sea (Antarctica), brine samples were collected from
	first year sea ice and analysed for salinity, temperature, dissolved
	oxygen and major nutrient concentrations. Additionally, the carbonate
	system was determined from measurements of pH and total alkalinity.
	During winter, brine chemical composition was largely determined
	by seawater concentration in the course of freezing. Brine temperatures
	ranged from -1.9 to -6.7 C. Precipitation of calcium carbonate was
	not observed at the corresponding salinity range of 34 to 108. Removal
	of carbon from the total inorganic carbon pool (up to 500 [mu]mol
	Ct kg-1) was related to reduced nutrient concentrations, indicating
	the presence of photosynthetically active ice algal assemblages in
	the winter sea ice. However, nutrient and inorganic carbon concentrations
	did generally not reach growth limiting levels for phytoplankton.
	The combined effect of photosynthesis and physical concentration
	resulted in O2 concentrations of up to 650 [mu]mol kg-1. During summer,
	brine salinities ranged from 21 to 41 with most values > 28, showing
	that the net effect of freezing and melting on brine chemical composition
	was generally slight. Opposite to the winter situation, brine chemical
	composition was strongly influenced by biological activity. Photosynthetic
	carbon assimilation resulted in a Ct depletion of up to 1200 [mu]mol
	kg-1, which was associated with CO2 (aq) exhaustion and O2 concentrations
	as high as 933 [mu]mol kg-1. The concurrent depletion of major nutrients
	generally corresponded to uptake ratios predicted from phytoplankton
	biochemical composition. Primary productivity in summer sea ice is
	apparently sustained until inorganic resources are fully exhausted,
	resulting in brine chemical compositions that differ profoundly from
	those of surface waters. This may have important implications for
	pathways of ice algal carbon acquisition, carbon isotope fractionation
	as well as for species distribution in the open water phytoplankton.},

	of clonal divergence and periodic selection, must be augmented to
	embrace gene exchange as a creative force, itself responsible for
	much of the pattern of similarities and differences we see between
	prokaryotic microbes. Rather than replacing periodic selection on
	genetic diversity, gene loss, and other chromosomal alterations as
	important players in adaptive evolution, gene exchange acts in concert
	with these processes to provide a rich explanatory paradigm-some
	of whose implications we explore here. In particular, we discuss
	(1) the role of recombination and HGT in giving phenotypic "coherence"
	to prokaryotic taxa at all levels of inclusiveness, (2) the implications
	of these processes for the reconstruction and meaning of "phylogeny,"

	The abundances of bacteria, diatoms, and photo-and heterotrophic

	of protists is selective, showing preference for diatoms with a relatively
	large cell size and (iii) enrichment of organisms, in particular
	diatoms, takes place in young sea ice in the Greenland Sea. The selectivity
	df the incorporation process and the evident preference for diatoms
	are presumably a result of the larger cell size and/or certain properties

	incorporation into DNA changed during ice growth. In thick pack ice,

	reduced mortality rates of bacteria within the small brine pores.
	In the course of ice development, bacterial carbon production increased

	conditions in the laboratory. Distribution patterns and metabolic
	activities of three common Southern Ocean diatoms (Nitzschia curta,
	Thalassiosira tumida, Chaetoceros sp.) and an Antarctic bacterial
	community were determined after 3 and 14 days of incubation in an
	insulated 301 plastic vessel. Activity measurements suggest that
	a close coupling existed between these two groups of organisms prior
	to ice formation. After 3 days of freezing at -5 degrees C, cell
	densities and biomasses of algae increased in pore water within an
	ice-pancake that formed during this period. Accumulation in the pore
	water exceeded the concentration effect caused by freezing out of
	water. Bacteria showed similar increases in the presence of algal
	cells during freezing. As the ice incorporated bacterial populations
	experienced a strong metabolic inhibition, bacterial growth as a
	reason for enhanced cell numbers in the pore water seems to be unlikely.
	Reduced metabolic activities were also recorded for the algal species,
	most pronounced in T. tumida which showed lowest cell-specific assimilation
	rates accompanied by a high cell mortality after 3 days of freezing.
	It is hypothesized that scavenging of algal cells by ice crystals
	in conjunction with attachment of bacteria onto algal cells was predominantly
	responsible for the observed enrichment patterns. Different capacities
	of the algae to concentrate bacterial cells in the pore water were
	related to differences in algal surface area available for bacterial
	colonization, which varied among the three species due to different
	morphologies and cell concentrations. After 2 weeks of incubation
	under simulated ice conditions and at salinities of 50 parts per
	thousand, activity of algae and bacteria increased again. In contrast
	to observations made in open water prior to freezing, no influence
	of algal species on bacterial activity was recorded after this 2-week
	period. It is concluded that a bacterial community different to that
	of the open water had developed which needs a longer time span than
	employed in the present experiment to establish close metabolic coupling
	between algae and bacteria as recorded for microbial communities

	The consolidated sea ice had a very heterogeneous horizontal distribution
	of microbes on large as well as small scales but vertical profiles
	in low and densely populated ice cores exhibited similar patterns.
	A close relation between bacterial colonization of sea ice and genetic
	ice classes was revealed. Sea ice of the 'predominantly congelation
	ice' had the lowest bacterial biomass and displayed Very low heterotrophic
	activities which were comparable to those of the water column. Samples
	of older sea ice belonging to the 'mainly frazil' and 'mixed ice'
	had maximal numbers of bacteria. They often included high proportions
	of culturable cells and dividing cells as well as large bacteria.
	The bacteria of these ice classes were active and contributed significantly
	to the productivity in the Weddell Sea during winter. 'Predominantly
	frazil ice' was less colonized; however, selective bacterial growth
	was also indicated in this typical winter ice by an increase in the
	proportions of culturable and psychrophilic bacteria with advancing
	age of the ice. Psychrophilic bacteria dominated in consolidated
	sea-ice whereas facultative psychrophiles prevailed in young sea-ice
	and water, corroborating a strict partitioning in a microbial sea-ice
	and a seawater regime. Generally, temperature does not appear to
	be the significant factor for the development of bacterial communities
	in the surface layer of the eastern Weddell Sea in winter since the
	metabolically active bacterial nora develops in the very cold sea-ice
	environment. The organic matter supply and its improved usability

	Here we show that one of these molecules, produced by the sea ice
	diatom Navicula glaciei Vanheurk, is a â¼25Â kDa ice-binding protein
	(IBP). A cDNA obtained from another sea ice diatom, Fragilariopsis

  abstract = {Mechanisms of air-snow exchange of mercury (Hg) during and after atmospheric
	mercury depletion events (AMDEs) remain poorly constrained and this
	has limited our understanding of the arctic Hg cycle. We measured
	the Hg concentrations of surface snow through time and carried out
	flux chamber experiments during AMDE and non-AMDE conditions in the
	spring of 2006 near Barrow, Alaska. Clear skies, low-velocity onshore
	winds, and a stable boundary layer characterized the meteorology
	during this AMDE. Surface snow Hg concentrations (upper 1 cm) increased
	throughout a 9-day AMDE from background levels (4.1â15.5 ng/L)
	to elevated levels (147 and 237 ng/L) at two sampling sites and returned
	to near-baseline values within 2 days of AMDE cessation. The Hg concentrations
	of core samples from the full snowpack did not increase significantly
	during the AMDE and demonstrate that the Hg enhancement of surface
	snow resulted from deposition of atmospheric Hg to surface snow.
	We estimate that complete deposition of background Hg to a height
	of 200â450 m in the near-surface troposphere could account for
	the Hg gains to surface snow during this event. Snow incubated in
	field-based flux chambers emitted 4 to 7% of its total Hg content
	within 1 day and may represent an upper limit for the photo-reduction
	rate of âeasilyâ reducible Hg in snow under post-AMDE conditions.
	Full-column snow core samples collected in the late springtime have
	comparable Hg loads to those observed during the AMDE season and
	imply that a significant fraction of the Hg deposited during the
	3-month AMDE season was retained until snowmelt at this location.},

	possesses two isoforms of a protein with TH activity. A high homology

  abstract = {Dissolved DNA (dDNA) is a potentially important source of energy and
	nutrients in aquatic ecosystems. However, little is known about the
	identity, metabolism, and interactions of the microorganisms capable
	of consuming dDNA. Bacteria from Eel Pond (Woods Hole, MA) were cultivated
	on low-molecular-weight (LMW) or high-molecular-weight (HMW) dDNA,
	which served as the primary source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
	Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that distinct bacterial
	assemblages with comparable levels of taxon richness developed on
	LMW and HMW dDNA. Since the LMW and HMW dDNA used in this study were
	stoichiometrically identical, the results confirm that the size alone
	of dissolved organic matter can influence bacterial community composition.
	Variation in the growth and metabolism of isolates provided insight
	into mechanisms that may have generated differences in bacterial
	community composition. For example, bacteria from LMW dDNA enrichments
	generally grew better on LMW dDNA than on HMW dDNA. In contrast,
	bacteria isolated from HMW dDNA enrichments were more effective at
	degrading HMW dDNA than bacteria isolated from LMW dDNA enrichments.
	Thus, marine bacteria may experience a trade-off between their ability
	to compete for LMW dDNA and their ability to access HMW dDNA via
	extracellular nuclease production. Together, the results of this
	study suggest that dDNA turnover in marine ecosystems may involve
	a succession of microbial assemblages with specialized ecological
	strategies.},

  volume = {58},
  pages = {563--602},
  abstract = {Natural genetic transformation is the active uptake of free DNA by
	bacterial cells and the heritable incorporation of its genetic information.
	Since the famous discovery of transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae
	by Griffith in 1928 and the demonstration of DNA as the transforming
	principle by Avery and coworkers in 1944, cellular processes involved
	in transformation have been studied extensively by in vitro experimentation
	with a few transformable species. Only more recently has it been
	considered that transformation may be a powerful mechanism of horizontal
	gene transfer in natural bacterial populations. In this review the
	current understanding of the biology of transformation is summarized
	to provide the platform on which aspects of bacterial transformation
	in water soil, and sediments and the habitat of pathogens are discussed.
	Direct and indirect evidence for gene transfer routes by transformation
	within species and between different species will be presented, along
	with data suggesting that plasmids as well as chromosomal DNA are
	subject to genetic exchange via transformation. Experiments exploring
	the prerequisites for transformation in the environment, including
	the production and persistence of free DNA and factors important
	for the uptake of DNA by cells, will be compiled, as well as possible
	natural barriers to transformation. The efficiency of gene transfer
	by transformation in bacterial habitats is possibly genetically adjusted
	to submaximal levels. The fact that natural transformation has been
	detected among bacteria from all trophic and taxonomic groups including
	archaebacteria suggests that transformability evolved early in phylogeny.
	Probable functions of DNA uptake other than gene acquisition will
	be discussed. The body of information presently available suggests
	that transformation has a great impact on bacterial population dynamics
	as well as on bacterial evolution and speciation.},

	bacterium with natural competence (Bacillus subtilis) can take up
	transforming DNA adsorbed to sand minerals. Here we examined whether
	also a naturally transformable soil bacterium of the gram-negative
	pseudomonad (Pseudomonas stutzeri) can be transformed by mineral-associated
	DNA. For these studies the transformation protocol of this species
	was further improved and characterized. The peak of competence during
	growth of P. stutzeri was determined to occur at the beginning of
	the stationary phase. The competence state was conserved during shock
	freezing and thawing of cells in 10\% glycerol. Kinetic experiments
	showed that transformant formation after addition of DNA to competent
	cells proceeded for more than 2 h with DNA adsorption to cells being
	the rate limiting step. By means of the defined protocol P. stutzeri
	was shown to be transformed by sand-adsorbed DNA. Transformation
	by adsorbed or dissolved DNA occurred between 16 degrees and 44 degrees
	C. Efficiency and DNaseI-sensitivity of transformation by DNA adsorbed
	to sand or in liquid were comparable. It is concluded that uptake
	of particle-bound DNA by P. stutzeri in soil is possible. This finding
	adds evidence to the view that transformation occurs in natural environments
	where DNA is assumed to be significantly associated with mineral/particulate
	material and thereby is protected against enzymatic degradation.},

	2 h. The amounts of DNA which adsorbed to sand increased with the
	salt concentration (0.1 to 4 M NaCl and 1 mM to 0.2 M MgCl2), salt
	valency (Na+ less than Mg2+ and Ca2+), and pH (5 to 9). Maximum desorption
	of DNA from sand (43 to 59\%) was achieved when columns were eluted
	with NaPO4 and NaCl for 6 h or with EDTA for 1 h. DNA did not desorb
	in the presence of detergents. It is concluded that adsorption proceeded
	by physical and chemical (Mg2+ bridging) interaction between the
	DNA and sand surfaces. Degradability by DNase I decreased upon adsorption
	of transforming DNA. When DNA adsorbed in the presence of 50 mM MgCl2,
	the degradation rate was higher than when it adsorbed in the presence

	sand at 50 mM MgCl2 decreased when the columns were eluted with 0.1
	mM MgCl2 or 100 mM EDTA before application of DNase I. This indicates
	that at least two types of DNA-sand complexes with different accessibilities
	of adsorbed DNA to DNase I existed. The degradability of DNA adsorbed

	The disequilibrium between phage and bacterial growth and abundance
	maxima during the spring bloom is suggested to be due to (1) a change
	in the makeup of the bacterial community, such that phage-resistant
	bacteria proliferated later in the spring, or (2) an increase in

  abstract = {Despite the Arctic sea ice cover's recognized sensitivity to environmental
	change, the role of sediment inclusions in lowering ice albedo and
	affecting ice ablation is poorly understood. Sea ice sediment inclusions
	were studied in the central Arctic Ocean during the Arctic 91 expedition
	and in the Laptev Sea (East Siberian Arctic Region Expedition 1992).
	Results from these investigations are here combined with previous
	studies performed in major areas of ice ablation and the southern
	central Arctic Ocean. This study documents the regional distribution
	and composition of particle-laden ice, investigates and evaluates
	processes by which sediment is incorporated into the ice cover, and
	identifies transport paths and probable depositional centers for
	the released sediment. In April 1992, sea ice in the Laptev Sea was
	relatively clean. The sediment occasionally observed was distributed
	diffusely over the entire ice column, forming turbid ice. Observations
	indicate that frazil and anchor ice formation occurring in a large
	coastal polynya provide a main mechanism for sediment entrainment.
	In the central Arctic Ocean sediments are concentrated in layers
	within or at the surface of ice floes due to melting and refreezing
	processes. The surface sediment accumulation in central Arctic multi-year
	sea ice exceeds by far the amounts observed in first-year ice from
	the Laptev Sea in April 1992. Sea ice sediments are generally fine
	grained, although coarse sediments and stones up to 5 cm in diameter
	are observed. Component analysis indicates that quartz and clay minerals
	are the main terrigenous sediment particles. The biogenous components,
	namely shells of pelecypods and benthic foraminiferal tests, point
	to a shallow, benthic, marine source area. Apparently, sediment inclusions
	were resuspended from shelf areas before and incorporated into the
	sea ice by suspension freezing. Clay mineralogy of ice-rafted sediments
	provides information on potential source areas. A smectite maximum
	in sea ice sediment samples repeatedly occurred between 81 degrees
	N and 83 degrees N along the Arctic 91 transect, indicating a rather
	stable and narrow smectite rich ice drift stream of the Transpolar
	Drift. The smectite concentrations are comparable to those found
	in both Laptev Sea shelf sediments and anchor ice sediments, pointing
	to this sea as a potential source area for sea ice sediments. In
	the central Arctic Ocean sea ice clay mineralogy is significantly
	different from deep-sea clay mineral distribution patterns. The contribution
	of sea ice sediments to the deep sea is apparently diluted by sedimentary
	material provided by other transport mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Dissolved DNA and microbial biomass and activity parameters were measured
	over a 15-month period at three stations along a salinity gradient
	in Tampa Bay, Fla. Dissolved DNA showed seasonal variation, with
	minimal values in December and January and maximal values in summer
	months (July and August). This pattern of seasonal variation followed
	that of particulate DNA and water temperature and did not correlate
	with bacterioplankton (direct counts and [H]thymidine incorporation)
	or phytoplankton (chlorophyll a and CO(2) fixation) biomass and activity.
	Microautotrophic populations showed maxima in the spring and fall,
	whereas microheterotrophic activity was greatest in late summer (September).
	Both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial activity was greatest
	at the high estuarine (low salinity) station and lowest at the mouth
	of the bay (high salinity station), irrespective of season. Dissolved
	DNA carbon and phosphorus constituted 0.11 +/- 0.05\% of the dissolved
	organic carbon and 6.6 +/- 6.5\% of the dissolved organic phosphorus,
	respectively. Strong diel periodicity was noted in dissolved DNA
	and in microbial activity in Bayboro Harbor during the dry season.
	A noon maximum in primary productivity was followed by an 8 p.m.
	maximum in heterotrophic activity and a midnight maximum in dissolved
	DNA. This diel periodicity was less pronounced in the wet season,
	when microbial parameters were strongly influenced by episodic inputs
	of freshwater. These results suggest that seasonal and diel production
	of dissolved DNA is driven by primary production, either through
	direct DNA release by phytoplankton, or more likely, through growth
	of bacterioplankton on phytoplankton exudates, followed by excretion
	and lysis.},

	To assess the impact of enhanced incident ultraviolet irradiance
	on this community, a knowledge of the amount of light transmitted
	through a sea ice cover is necessary. A two-stream radiative transfer
	model is used to estimate the penetration of ultraviolet radiation
	through Antarctic sea ice. Sea ice optical properties were used as
	proxies to infer scattering and absorption coefficients at ultraviolet
	wavelengths. Case studies are reported for sea ice in McMurdo Sound
	and in the Weddell Sea. Values of spectral transmittance are computed
	as well as integrated transmitted UV-B, UV-A, biologically effective
	irradiance (BEI), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).
	UV-B light levels under meter-thick ice are a few percent of incident
	values. The presence of a snow cover results in a large decrease
	in transmitted ultraviolet. Snow and ice ameliorate the biological
	impact of enhanced levels of incident ultraviolet radiation by reducing

	between 24 February and 20 June 2004 and analyzed for exopolymeric
	substances (EPS), particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll
	a (chl a). Concentrations of EPS were measured using Alcian blue
	staining of melted ice samples. Chl a and bacterial sinking velocities
	were also assessed with settling columns, to determine the potential
	role of EPS in the transport of sea-ice biomass. EPS concentrations
	in the bottom ice were consistently low in March (avg. 185 µg xanthan
	equivalents l?1), after which they increased to maximum values of
	4930 and 10500 µg Xequiv. l?1 under high and low snow cover, respectively.
	EPS concentrations in the surface water were consistently 2 orders
	of magnitude lower than in the sea ice. Sea-ice EPS concentrations
	were significantly correlated with sea-ice chl a biomass (? = 0.70,
	p < 0.01). Sea-ice algae were primarily responsible for EPS production
	within the sea ice, whereas bacteria produced insignificant amounts
	of sea-ice EPS. EPS-carbon contributed, on average, 23% of POC concentrations
	within the sea ice, with maximum values reaching 72% during the melt
	period. Median chl a sinking velocities were 0.11 and 0.44 m d?1
	under high and low snow cover, respectively. EPS had little effect
	on chl a sinking velocities. However, bacterial sinking velocities
	did appear to be influenced by diatom-associated and free EPS within
	the sea ice. Diatom-associated EPS could facilitate the attachment
	of bacteria to algae thereby increasing bacterial sinking velocities,
	whereas the sinking velocities of bacteria associated with positively
	buoyant, free EPS, could be reduced. EPS contributed significantly
	to the sea-ice carbon pool and influenced the sedimentation of sea-ice
	biomass, which emphasizes the important role of EPS in carbon cycling

	process. Bivalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+) were 100-fold more effective
	than monovalent cations (Na+, K+, NH4+). Quantitative adsorption
	of up to 1 microgram of negatively supercoiled or linearized plasmid
	DNA to 0.7 g of sand was observed in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 at

	Supercoil molecules adsorbed slightly less than linearized or open

	charges on the DNA molecules and the mineral surfaces by cations.
	The results are discussed on the grounds of the polyelectrolyte adsorption

	the horizontal gene pool (HGP) promotes the evolution and adaptation

  abstract = {The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of bacterial biofilms
	form a hydrated barrier between cells and their external environment.
	Better characterization of EPS could be useful in understanding biofilm
	physiology. The EPS are chemically complex, changing with both bacterial
	strain and culture conditions. Previously, we reported that Pseudomonas
	aeruginosa unsaturated biofilm EPS contains large amounts of extracellular
	DNA (eDNA) (R. E. Steinberger, A. R. Allen, H. G. Hansma, and P.
	A. Holden, Microb. Ecol. 43:416-423,2002). Here, we investigated
	the compositional similarity of eDNA to cellular DNA, the relative
	quantity of eDNA, and the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
	(TRFLP) community profile of eDNA in multiple-species biofilms. By
	randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, cellular DNA and eDNA
	appear identical for P. aeruginosa biofilms. Significantly more eDNA
	was produced in P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida biofilms than
	in Rhodococcus erythropolis or Variovorax paradoxus biofilms. While
	the amount of eDNA in dual-species biofilms was of the same order
	of magnitude as that of of single-species biofilms, the amounts were
	not predictable from single-strain measurements. By the Shannon diversity
	index and principle components analysis of TRFLP profiles generated
	from 16S rRNA genes, eDNA of four-species biofilms differed significantly
	from either cellular or total DNA of the same biofilm. However, total
	DNA- and cellular DNA-based TRFLP analyses of this biofilm community
	yielded identical results. We conclude that extracellular DNA production
	in unsaturated biofilms is species dependent and that the phylogenetic
	information contained in this DNA pool is quantifiable and distinct
	from either total or cellular DNA.},

  abstract = {The capacity of marine sediments of facilitate natural transformation
	of Pseudomonas stutzeri strain ZoBell was investigated. The role

	While transformation frequencies increased as a function of DNA concentrations
	from 0 to 1.0-mu-g of DNA from rifampin-resistant strains for filter
	transformations, transformation in autoclaved sediment columns displayed
	a reduction in transformation frequency in response to low DNA concentrations
	(0-1.0-mu-g/cm3 sediment). Maximum transformation frequencies were
	obtained on filters at 1.0-mu-g exogenous DNA, however, maximum frequencies
	were not reached in sediments until a DNA concentration of 3.0-mu-g/cm3
	sediment was added. When autoclaved sediments were pre-loaded with
	excess calf thymus DNA, this reduction in response of transformation
	frequency (cf. filter transformation) was eliminated, i.e., tranformation
	frequencies reached saturation in the preloaded sediments at 1.0-mu-g
	DNA/cm3. Autoclaved sediments were shown to bind DNA at a concentration
	of about 3.6-mu-g/cm3 sediment, and maximum transformation frequencies
	were only obtained when these sediments were saturated with DNA.
	These data indicate that autoclaved marine sediments have the capacity
	to bind DNA in a form that prevents its availability for natural
	transformation and only after sediments are saturated with DNA does
	exogenous DNA become biologically active for natural transformation.},

  abstract = {We investigated the spatial characteristics of sedimentary inclusions
	and elucidated processes controlling their spatial and temporal variability
	in the fast ice cover of the shallow-marine environment of Elson
	Lagoon near Barrow, Alaska. This was accomplished by examining the
	frazil ice layer of sea-ice cores representing the 1998, 1999, and
	2000 fall freeze-up periods and comparing the results with a sediment
	resuspension model. Sediments occur exclusively as aggregates of
	clay to fine-silt sized particles that were confined to brine inclusions
	in the frazil ice. The average cross-sectional area of these aggregates
	is positively correlated with sediment concentration of the frazil
	ice (R-2=0.82, P<0.01). The minimum distance between neighboring
	aggregates (nearest-neighbor distance) is negatively correlated with
	sediment concentration (R-2=0.78, P<0.01). However, little correlation
	exists between the number of aggregates and sediment concentration.
	Sediment concentrations ranged from 24 to 1470 mg L-1 and sediment
	loads ranged from 2 g m(-2) to 384 g m(-2), with 1998 and 2000 sediment
	loads being one to two orders of magnitude smaller than 1999 sediment
	loads. Similarly, the potential for bottom-sediment resuspension
	was greater in 1999 than in 1998 and 2000 by more than a factor of
	two. Resuspension potential is controlled spatially by the local
	bathymetry and interannually by wind velocity and fetch. At submeter
	scales, increases in bottom sediment resuspension result in greater
	sea-ice sediment concentrations, larger aggregates, and smaller nearest-neighbor
	distances.},

	to covary during a study of diel dynamics of the microbial food web
	in the Adriatic Sea. This observation was further investigated in
	a continuous seawater culture when nanoflagellates were fed bacteria
	grown in filtered seawater. Analysis of dissolved organic phosphorus
	and dissolved DNA showed a sixfold increase of dissolved DNA in the
	presence of the nanoflagellates (Ochromonas sp.). The amount of DNA
	released suggested that the majority of the consumed bacterial DNA
	was ejected. Phagotrophic nanoflagellates thus represent an important
	source of origin for dissolved DNA. The rate of breakdown of dissolved
	DNA and release of inorganic phosphorus in the pelagic ecosystem
	is suggested to be dependent on the ambient phosphate pool. In the
	P-limited northern Adriatic Sea, rapid degradation of the labelled
	DNA could be demonstrated, whereas the N-limited southern California
	bight water showed a much lower rate. Phosphorus originating from
	dissolved DNA was shown to be transferred mainly to organisms in

  abstract = {We describe a model based on diffusion theory and the temperature-dependent
	mechanism of brine concentration in sea ice to argue that, if viruses
	partition with bacteria into sea-ice brine inclusions, contact rates
	between the two can be higher in winter sea ice than in seawater,
	increasing the probability of infection and possible virus production.
	To examine this hypothesis, we determined viral and bacterial concentrations
	in select winter sea-ice horizons using epifluorescence microscopy.
	Viral concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 82 x 10(6) Ml(-1) of brine
	volume of the ice, with highest values in brines from coldest (-24
	to -31 degrees C) ice horizons. Calculated virus-bacteria contact
	rates in underlying -1 degrees C seawater were similar to those in
	brines of -11 degrees C ice but up to 600 times lower than those
	in ice brines at or below -24 degrees C. We then incubated native
	bacterial and viral assemblages from winter sea ice for 8 days in
	brine at a temperature (-12 degrees C) and salinity (similar to 160
	psu) near expected in situ values, monitoring their concentrations
	microscopically. While different cores yielded different results,

	provided unambiguous evidence for viral persistence and production,

	microbial loop dominates energy flux and organic carbon utilization.
	Escherichia coli shows a similar nonlinear response to temperature

  abstract = {A theory for the evolution of cellular organization is presented.
	The model is based on the (data supported) conjecture that the dynamic
	of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is primarily determined by the
	organization of the recipient cell. Aboriginal cell designs are taken
	to be simple and loosely organized enough that all cellular componentry
	can be altered and/or displaced through HGT, making HGT the principal
	driving force in early cellular evolution. Primitive cells did not
	carry a stable organismal genealogical trace. Primitive cellular
	evolution is basically communal. The high level of novelty required
	to evolve cell designs is a product of communal invention, of the
	universal HGT field, not intralineage variation. It is the community
	as a whole, the ecosystem, which evolves. The individual cell designs
	that evolved in this way are nevertheless fundamentally distinct,
	because the initial conditions in each case are somewhat different.
	As a cell design becomes more complex and interconnected a critical
	point is reached where a more integrated cellular organization emerges,
	and vertically generated novelty can and does assume greater importance.
	This critical point is called the "Darwinian Threshold" for the reasons

	Roseobacter and Rhodobacter genomes contain a conserved gene transfer
	agent (GTA) gene cluster, and GTA-mediated gene transfer has been
	observed in these groups of bacteria. In this study, we investigated
	the genetic diversity of these two groups in Chesapeake Bay surface
	waters using a specific PCR primer set targeting the conserved Rhodobacterales
	GTA major capsid protein gene (g5). The g5 gene was successfully
	amplified from 26 Rhodobacterales isolates and the bay microbial
	communities using this primer set. Four g5 clone libraries were constructed
	from microbial assemblages representing different regions and seasons
	of the bay and yielded diverse sequences. In total, 12 distinct g5
	clusters could be identified among 158 Chesapeake Bay clones, 11
	fall within the Roseobacter clade, and one falls in the Rhodobacter
	clade. The vast majority of the clusters (10 out of 12) lack cultivated
	representatives. The composition of g5 sequences varied dramatically
	along the bay during the wintertime, and a distinct Roseobacter population
	composition between winter and summer was observed. The congruence
	between g5 and 16S rRNA gene phylogenies indicates that g5 may serve
	as a useful genetic marker to investigate diversity and abundance
	of Roseobacter and Rhodobacter in natural environments. The presence
	of the g5 gene in the natural populations of Roseobacter and Rhodobacter
