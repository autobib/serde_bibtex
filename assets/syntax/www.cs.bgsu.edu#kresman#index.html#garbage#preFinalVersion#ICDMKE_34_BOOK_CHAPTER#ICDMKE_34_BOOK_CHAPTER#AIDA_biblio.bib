	Abstract = {Privacy preserving data mining seeks to allow users to
		 share data while ensuring individual and corporate
		 privacy concerns are addressed. Recently algorithms
		 have been introduced to maintain privacy even when all
		 but two parties collude. However, exogenous information
		 and unwanted statistical disclosure can weaken
		 collusion requirements and allow for approximation of
		 sensitive information. Our work builds upon previous
		 algorithms, putting cycle-partitioned secure sum into
		 the mathematical framework of edge-disjoint Hamiltonian
		 cycles and providing an additional anonymous

@article{malin05,
	Abstract = {Standard multi-party computation models assume
		 semi-honest behavior, where the majority of
		 participants implement protocols according to
		 specification, an assumption not always plausible. In
		 this paper we introduce a multi-party protocol for
		 collaborative data analysis when participants are
		 malicious and fail to follow specification. The
		 protocol incorporates a semi-trusted third party, which
		 analyzes encrypted data and provides honest responses
		 that only intended recipients can successfully decrypt.
		 The protocol incorporates data confidentiality by
		 enabling participants to receive encrypted responses
		 tailored to their own encrypted data submissions
		 without revealing plaintext to other participants,
		 including the third party. As opposed to previous
		 models, trust need only be placed on a single
		 participant with no data at stake. Additionally, the
		 proposed protocol is configurable in a way that
		 security features are controlled by independent
		 subprotocols. Various combinations of subprotocols
		 allow for a flexible security system, appropriate for a
		 number of},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the issue of mining
		 association rules among items in a large database of
		 sales transactions. Mining association rules means that
		 given a database of sales transactions, to discover all
		 associations among items such that the presence of some
		 items in a transaction will imply the presence of other
		 items in the same transaction. The mining of
		 association rules can be mapped into the problem of
		 discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a
		 group of items which appear in a sufficient number of
		 transactions. The problem of discovering large itemsets
		 can be solved by constructing a candidate set of
		 itemsets first and then, identifying, within this
		 candidate set, those itemsets that meet the large
		 itemset requirement. Generally this is done iteratively
		 for each large k-itemset in increasing order of k where
		 a large k-itemset is a large itemset with k items. To
		 determine large itemsets from a huge number of
		 candidate large itemsets in early iterations...},

	Abstract = {Mining frequent patterns in transaction databases,
		 timeseries databases, and many other kinds of databases
		 has been studied popularly in data mining research.
		 Most of the previous studies adopt an Apriori-like
		 candidate set generation-and-test approach. However,
		 candidate set generation is still costly, especially
		 when there exist proli#c patterns and#or long patterns.
		 In this study,we propose a novel frequent pattern tree
		 #FP-tree# structure, which is an extended pre#xtree
		 structure for storing compressed, crucial information
		 about frequent patterns, and develop an e#cient
		 FP-tree- based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the
		 complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment
		 growth. E#ciency of mining is achieved with three
		 techniques: #1# a large database is compressed into a
		 highly condensed, much smaller data structure,
		 whichavoids costly, repeated database scans, #2# our
		 FP-tree-based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth
		 method to avoid the costly generation of a large n...},
