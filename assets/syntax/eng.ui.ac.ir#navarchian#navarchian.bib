abstract = "-Kinetics of the formation of poly(urethane-isocyanurate) (PUIR) from toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) in presence of dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) was investigated and the kinetic parameters of simultaneous reactions of urethane and isocyanurate formations have been obtained. The gelation behavior of PUIR was studied in the conventional batch reactor as well as in the internal mixer. The results showed that the gelation time can
be expressed as a power function of DBTDL concentration. The torque and temperature evolutions were used to present the extent of crosslinking reactions during the formation of PUIR in the internal mixer, while at higher catalyst concentrations the product has a microcellular structure due to extent of reaction between NCO groups and trace of water in polyol. This leads to different torque evolution at low and high DBTDL concentrations. It was also revealed that the catalyst does not affect significantly the peak exothermic temperature and time in the batch reactor. Also, the maximum and final values of torque and temperature are not so much influenced by catalyst concentration in the mixer. The PUIR samples have been characterized using FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM and swelling measurements. The data may be very useful for reactive extrusion of copolyurthanes

abstract = "-Abstract: In this article, the rheokinetics of polyurethane formation and the influence of shear rate on its kinetics have been studied. Two different linear polyurethane systems with 0% and 100% hard segments are examined in a cone and plate rheometer. The isothermal increase of viscosity during polyurethane formation has been measured at different shear rates and different temperatures and is modeled with an exponential function. The molecular weight vs. time curves and the reaction kinetic constants have been obtained for various shear rates and temperatures using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). It was concluded that kinetics of polyurethane formation is enhanced as the shear rate is increased. Phase separation is found to be responsible for irregularities in the viscosity build up due to formation of polyurethane with hard segments at high conversions.

abstract = "-Reactive extrusion of poly(urethane-isocyanurate) (PUIR) was studied in an intermeshing corotating twin-screw extruder. Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) were used as initial materials with dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) as catalyst. The reaction was first examined in a batch reactor as well as in an internal mixer in order to obtain the kinetics and temperature/torque evolution trends during the formation of PUIR, respectively. For the specified screw speed and temperature profile of the extruder, a working domain can be recommended for the reactive extrusion, in terms of NCO/OH ratio (r) and catalyst concentration (C), to reach a sufficient extent of reaction. The effects of screw speed and temperature profile on the residence time parameters of the reaction mixture were investigated. It is found that the axial mixing and the RTD behavior of the reaction mixture in the extruder can be well represented by the axial dispersion model. For the reaction condition of r = 3, C = 2%, and barrel temperature profiles of 75-150°C or 90-165°C, the optimum screw rotation speed for complete NCO conversion is 20 rpm. The structures, thermal stabilities, morphologies, and physical and dynamic mechanical properties of reactively extruded PUIRs were investigated.",

abstract = "-A kinetic study of the catalyzed reaction between toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) was carried out in the bulk state by using quantitative Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The polymerization was studied in the presence of the catalysts dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) and ferric acetylacetonate (FeAA) at three different temperatures. The kinetics was shown to obey a second-order scheme and the rate plots showed a distinct break in continuity, due to diferent reactivities of NCO groups. It was concluded that the appearance of this break point is related to the use of catalyst as well as type of polyol. The rate constants (k[1], k[2]) and the activation parameters (E[a1], E[a2], ?S[1]#, ?S[2]#) for the isocyanate groups in the para and ortho positions in TDI molecule were calculated. It was found that the reactivity of p-NCO is 5 to 8 fold higher than o-NCO. The temperature enhances the reactivity of o-NCO rather than the p-NCO. It was also concluded that the FeAA is more sensitive than DBTDL to temperature and is more selective to enhance the reactivity of the o-NCO.",

abstract = "-Poly(urethane-isocyanurate)s were synthesized by reacting toluene diisocyanate and poly(propylene glycol) with various stochiometric ratios (1-3) in the presence of different concentrations of dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) and ferric acetylacetonate (FeAA). The influence of the NCO/OH ratio and the catalyst type and concentration on the extent of urethane and isocyanurate formation were examined using Fourier transform IR spectroscopy. No trimer formation was observed in the presence of the FeAA catalyst. The percentage of the trimer group and the trimer/urethane content were found to be increased with increasing the stochiometric ratio or DBTDL concentration. The thermal decomposition of the copolyurethanes in an inert atmosphere was studied by means of thermogravimetry (TG). The TG curves showed three decomposition steps with the principal degradation temperature at about 355-385°C. The effects of the NCO/OH ratio, catalyst type and concentration, and heating rate on the thermal stability of the copolyurethanes were determined. The Flynn-Wall, Kissinger, and Ozawa methods were used to calculate the activation energies of thermal decomposition. The swelling behavior of solid copolyurethanes in toluene showed that, as the DBTDL concentration and/or NCO/OH ratio increased, the swelling ratio and average molecular weight between crosslinks were decreased whereas the crosslink density was increased. The sol fraction of solid copolyurethanes was examined and found to be reduced when the percentage of DBTDL or the stochiometric ratio was raised.",
