                 To solve it a new algorithm is introduced. This
                 combines a local minimum algorithm with a procedure
                 that decreases the measure of the region where the
                 global minimum is located. Specifically, by making use
                 of the condition (i), at each iteration of the
                 algorithm it is constructed a sequence of intervals
                 $s_j$, $s_j \subset S$, with the property that a global
                 minimum is not contained in the union of all the $s_j$.
                 A convergence property of the algorithm is given.",

                 discretization of linear ill-posed problems gives rise
                 to large ill-conditioned linear systems with the
                 right-hand side degraded by noise. The solution of such
                 linear systems requires the solution of minimization
                 problems with one quadratic constraint, depending on an
                 estimate of the variance of the noise. This strategy is
                 known as regularization. In this work, we propose a
                 modification of the Lagrange method for the solution of
                 the noise constrained regularization problem. We
                 present the numerical results of test problems, image
                 restoration and medical imaging denoising. Our results
                 indicate that the proposed Lagrange method is effective
                 and efficient in computing good regularized solutions
                 of ill-conditioned linear systems and in computing the
                 corresponding Lagrange multipliers. Moreover, our
                 numerical experiments show that the Lagrange method is
                 computationally convenient. Therefore, the Lagrange
                 method is a promising approach for dealing with
                 ill-posed problems.",

                 However, we are not able to make such a distinction at

                 problems. In this work we describe a simplified
                 complexity analysis that reliably shows when iterative
                 solution procedures are advantageous over direct
                 solution methods. The analysis involves an estimate of
                 the condition number of a matrix and can be used to
                 automatically decide at run time which method to use.
                 Accurate solutions are sought, therefore it can be
                 necessary to resort to high precision computations; the
                 cost of linear algebra in high precision, though, can
                 be prohibitively expensive. An established idea for the
                 accurate solution of linear systems is to use iterative
                 refinement (i) compute an initial solution $A X_0 = B$
                 in precision $p_0$; (ii) compute the residual $R_i =
                 B-A X_i$ in precision $p_i$; (iii) compute a correction
                 $A Z_i = R_i$ in precision $p_0$; (iv) correct the
                 solution $X_{i+1} = X_i + Z_i$ in precision $p_i$. It
                 has been recently shown that a modification of this
                 algorithm can be advantageous for high precision
                 computation [Geddes and Zheng, Exploiting Fast Hardware
                 Floating Point in High Precision Computation, Procs
                 {ISSAC}, 2003, 111--118]. This involves carrying out
                 the linear solution and refinement steps (i) and (iii)
                 using machine precision arithmetic $p_0$. Steps (ii)
                 and (iv) are then performed in monotonically increasing
                 precision $p_i > p_0$, using software arithmetic. Here
                 we also outline a scaling technique that is
                 advantageous when solving for the solution and
                 correction steps using machine precision.",

                 observation both constitute a source of distortion in
                 astronomical imaging. Assuming linearity and space
                 invariance of the image formation system, the observed
                 image can be expressed as the convolution of the
                 original image with the blurring function: if the
                 latter is known, then we are faced with the inverse
                 problem of classical deconvolution. The restoration
                 algorithms considered here try to remove the blur using
                 a priori constraints, without the knowledge of the
                 blurring function; this approach is often referred to
                 as blind deconvolution. It represents a variation of
                 the methods proposed in [Kundur and Hatzinakos, A Novel
                 Blind Deconvolution Scheme for Image Restoration using
                 Recursive Filtering, {IEEE} Transactions on Signal

                 1130--1134]. The programming environment is that of
                 Mathematica. The effectiveness of this class of methods
                 is tested on both simulated and real data derived from
                 various applications. Comparison with the behavior of
                 the methods by Kundur-Hatzinakos and by

                 Gay and R. Fourer, it is able to model and solve
                 problems ranging from student examples to very complex,
                 higly nonlinear industrial applications. For the
                 problem solution, {AMPL} needs to call an external
                 solver that provides the capabilities required to solve
                 the problem at hand. Despite the today quite wide set
                 of numerical solvers supplying an {AMPL} interface
                 (thus being callable from inside the {AMPL} interactive
                 environment), it would be very interesting for both
                 researchers and practitioners to be able to provide
                 their own custom-made solvers to {AMPL}. Unfortunately,
                 this is not as easy as one would hope. David Gay
                 explains in its guide {``}{H}ooking your solver to
                 {AMPL}{''} how to use some of the C coded {AMPL}
                 library functions, in order to make {AMPL} working with
                 a custom solver, but the description is quite
                 fragmented and relates a lot on the C coded example
                 routines coming with the {AMPL} freely downloadable
                 version. In this report we try to build a more
                 {``}structured{''} approach to the problem of hooking a
                 custom solver to {AMPL}, by providing a sort of
                 reference guide to the many library routines that one
                 needs to call from its own code. This rough document is
                 still just an {``}add-on{''} to the Gay's guide and it
                 is intended to help the programmers to better
                 understand how to call a given routine and where to
                 find description/examples/suggestions on its use. These
                 are the easier tasks. The most difficult tasks, that is
                 to say which, why and when a routine must/can be called

                 with hermitian Toeplitz matrix and noisy right hand
                 side. We analyze the behaviour of some regularization
                 methods, such as the {T}runcated {S}ingular {V}alue
                 {D}ecomposition, the Lavrent'yev regularization method
                 and Conjugate Gradients type iterative methods. For
                 what concerns the choice of the regularization
                 parameter, we use some known methods and we propose new
                 heuristic criteria for iterative regularization
                 methods. The simulations are carried on test problems
                 obtained from real data acquired on a 1.5 Tesla
                 Phillips system.",

                 optimization problem of searching the global minimum of
                 a multiextremal multidimensional Lipschitz function
                 over a hyperinterval. We present a new multidimensional
                 diagonal algorithm belonging to the class of
                 information global optimization methods. It is supposed
                 that the Lipschitz constant is unknown and only the
                 values of the objective function can be evaluated. The
                 new method uses local tuning on the behaviour of the
                 objective function to accelerate the search adaptively
                 estimating local Lipschitz constants during
                 minimization. Sufficient convergence conditions are
                 established for the proposed technique. Numerical
                 examples are also reported.",
