  abstract = {The amount of data of all kinds available electronically has increased
	dramatically in recent years. The data resides in different forms,
	ranging from unstructured data in file systems to highly structured
	in relational database systems. Data is accessible through a variety
	of interfaces including Web browsers, database query languages, application-specific
	interfaces, or data exchange formats. Some of this data is raw data,
	e.g. images or sound. Some of it has structure even if the structure
	is often implicit, and not as rigid or regular as that found in standard
	database systems. Sometimes the structure exists but has to be extracted
	from the data. Sometimes also it exists but we prefer to ignore it
	for certain purposes such as browsing. We call here semi-structured
	data this data that is (from a particular viewpoint) neither raw
	data nor strictly typed, i.e., not table-oriented as in a relational
	model or sorted-graph as in object databases...},

	usually formatted for its users, which makes it difficult to extract
	relevant data from various sources. Therefore, the availability of
	robust, flexible Information Extraction (IE) systems that transform
	the Web pages into program-friendly structures such as a relational
	database will become a great necessity. Although many approaches
	for data extraction from Web pages have been developed, there has
	been limited effort to compare such tools. Unfortunately, in only
	a few cases can the results generated by distinct tools be directly
	compared since the addressed extraction tasks are different. This
	paper surveys the major Web data extraction approaches and compares
	them in three dimensions: the task domain, the automation degree,
	and the techniques used. The criteria of the first dimension explain
	why an IE system fails to handle some Web sites of particular structures.
	The criteria of the second dimension classify IE systems based on
	the techniques used. The criteria of the third dimension measure
	the degree of automation for IE systems. We believe these criteria
	provide qualitatively measures to evaluate various IE approaches.},

	Specifically, they investigate a method for dealing with domain and

	vocabularies from two sources: Wikipedia and the original annotated
	corpus, they improve their tagger on Wikipedia. Moreover, by applying

  abstract = {Information retrieval (IR) is about finding documents which may be
	of relevance to a user's query, from within a corpus or collection
	of texts. While apparently a simple task at first glance, IR is in
	fact a hard problem because of the subtleties introduced by the use
	of natural language in both documents and in queries. The automatic
	processing of natural language clearly represents significant potential
	for improving information retrieval tasks because of the dominance
	of the natural language medium on the whole IR task. Information
	extraction is also fundamentally about dealing with natural language
	albeit for a different function. It is thus of interest to the IE
	community to see how a related task, perhaps the most-related task,
	IR, has managed to use the same NLP base technology in its development
	so far. This is an especially valid comparison to make since IR has
	been the subject of research and development and has been delivering

  abstract = {Commercial search engines are now playing an increasingly important
	role in Web information dissemination and access. Of particular interest
	to business and national governments is whether the big engines have
	coverage biased towards the U.S. or other countries. In our study
	we tested for national biases in three major search engines and found
	significant differences in their coverage of commercial Web sites.
	The U.S. sites were much better covered than the others in the study:
	sites from China, Taiwan and Singapore. We then examined the possible
	technical causes of the differences and found that the language of
	a site does not affect its coverage by search engines. However, the
	visibility of a site, measured by the number of links to it, affects
	its chance to be covered by search engines. We conclude that the
	coverage bias does exist but this is due not to deliberate choices
	of the search engines but occurs as a natural result of cumulative
	advantage effects of U.S. sites on the Web. Nevertheless, the bias
	remains a cause for international concern.},

  abstract = {this paper, between traditional IR and the newer IE , is not totally
	clear everywhere but can itself become a question of degree. Suppose
	parsing systems that produce syntactic and logical representations
	were so good, as some now believe, that they could process huge corpora
	in an acceptably short time. One can then think of the traditional
	task of computer question answering in two quite different ways.
	The old way was to translate a question into a formalised language
	like SQL and use it to retrieve information from a database- as in
	"Tell me all the IBM executives over 40 earning under $50K a year".
	But with a full parser of large corpora one could now imagine transforming
	ing the query to form an IE template and searching the WHOLE TEXT
	(not a data base) for all examples of such employees---both methods
	should produce exactly the same result starting from different information
	sources --- a text versus a formalised database. What we have called
	an IE template can now be seen as a kind of frozen query that one
	can reuse many times on a corpus and is therefore only important
	when one wants stereotypical, repetitive, information back rather
	than the answer to one-off questions. "Tell me the height of Everest?",
	as a question addressed to a formalised text corpus is then neither
	a IR nor IE but a perfectly reasonable single request for an answer.
	"Tell me about fungi", addressed to a text corpus with an IR system,
	will produce a set of relevant documents but no particular answer.
	Tell me what films my favourite movie critics likes, addressed to
	the right text corpus , is undoubtedly IE as we saw, and will produce
	an answer also. The needs and the resources available determine the
	techniques that are relevant, and those in turn determine what it
	is to answer a questio...},
