  abstract =     {P. Cavanagh (see ibid., vol.22, p.1409-12, 1982) has
                  presented evidence that 'functional size invariance
                  is not provided by the cortical magnification
                  factor' and has incorrectly claimed that the author
                  has stated the hypothesis that 'functional size
                  invariance' is provided by the cortical
                  magnification factor. The principal point of this
                  note is to demonstrate, by direct citation of
                  relevant literature, that striate cortical mapping,
                  alone, cannot provide a functional basis for
                  perceptual invariance, but that it may well have
                  some role to play in providing an anatomical basis
                  for visual computation. Whether the visual system
                  has a local architecture which is described as a
                  complex logarithmic mapping (Schwartz, 1976, 1977,
                  1980, Dodson, 1980) or as a 'log polar frequency
                  mapping' (Cavanagh, 1978), or neither, is at present
                  an open experimental question.},
