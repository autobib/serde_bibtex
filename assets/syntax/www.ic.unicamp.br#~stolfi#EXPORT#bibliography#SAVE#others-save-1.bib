    In this paper, we propose a new strategy for detecting the joint
    among two potsherds. Joint detection problems were studied in jigsaw
    puzzle assembling. However, the shape assumptions of a piece used in
    the past researches cannot be applied to joint detection to
    reconstruct broken earthenware. To detect the joint, the most similar
    section among two contours must be detected by partial verification.
    In our strategy, each contour is segmented for partial verification
    without making any assumption about the shape of a potsherd, unlike
    previous jigsaw puzzle assembling methods.
  \par
    Our strategy consists of five processes: the contour segmentation
    process, the segment description process, the segment verification
    process, the candidate extraction process, and the candidate
    verification process. We also present experimental results of our
    strategy with two-dimensional images of potsherds.
  \par
    Keywords: Joint Detection, Partical Verification of Contours,
    Reconstruction of Broken Earthenware

    are implemented using fixed precision arithmetic such as floating point, they
    can produce incorrect answers; when they are implemented using
    arbitrary-precision arithmetic, they are expensive to compute. We present
    adaptive-precision algorithms for finding the signs of determinants of
    matrices with integer and rational elements. These algorithms were developed
    and tested by integrating them into the Guibas-Stolfi Delaunay triangulation
    algorithm. Through a combination of algorithm design and careful engineering
    of the implementation, the resulting program can triangulate a set of random
    rational points in the unit circle only four to five times slower than can a
    floating-point implementation of the algorithm. The algorithms, engineering
    process, and software tools developed are described.},

  reconstructing the surfaces of three-dimensional
  objects, given a collection of planar contours
  representing cross sections through the objects. This
  problem has important applications in bio-medical
  research and instruction, solid modeling, and
  industrial inspection. The problem can be broken into
  four subproblems, the correspondence problem, the
  tiling problem, the branching problem, and the surface
  fitting problem. We describe our system for surface
  reconstruction from sets of contours with respect to
  each of these subproblems. Special attention is given
  to the correspondence and branching problems. We
  present a method which can handle sets of contours in
  which adjacent contours share a very contorted
  boundary."
