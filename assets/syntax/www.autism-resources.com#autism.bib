%X In *Mindblindness*, Simon Baron-Cohen presents a
 model of the evolution and development of "mindreading."  [As far as I
 can tell from reviews, he is not referring to extra-sensory powers,
 but uses the term "mindreading" to mean the unconscious deductions &
 educated guesses we make about other peoples' minds -ed] He argues
 that we mindread all the time, effortlessly, automatically, and mostly
 unconsciously.  It is the natural way in which we interpret, predict,
 and participate in social behavior and communication.  We ascribe
 mental states to people: states such as thoughts, desires, knowledge,
 and intentions.  Building on many years of research, Baron-Cohen
 concludes that children with autism, suffer from "mindblindness" as a
 result of a selective impairment in mindreading.  For these children,
 the world is essentially devoid of mental things.  Note: Newsweek
 1995/8/14 has an article featuring this book.

 Presents a case history of a child who is variously described as
 autistic, schizophrenic, and retarded, who is rescued by the therapist
 author from his over-protective mother. It's unclear whether she
 believes that his mother caused all his problems or was merely
 exacerbating them. The book only reveals in very very small print that
 it's "a composite of a number of cases of the problems faced by the
 social service and medical profession in the diagnosis, treatment, and
 development of capabilities of such children" (i.e. this didn't
 actually take place).

 This is an autobiographical book by Temple Grandin, with Margaret
 Scariano. It offers insight into the frustrations that people labeled
 autistic have during the time they are trying to develop an ability to
 communicate.  This is considered a rare autobiographical account in as
 much as the majority of the people with autism have not developed such
 sophisticated communication abilities.  Very highly recommended by a
 number of readers.

%X 326 pages.  A psychoanalytic view of Autism (Note: the psychoanalytic
 theories are no longer wide held).  Frances Tustin developed a
 hypothesis that "early-childhood autism is a two-stage illness:  the
 first stage being an unduly close association with the mother, the
 father often being virtually absent or excluded. Such a child has been
 described as a `cork child' to plug the hole of the mother's
 depression and loneliness. The second stage is when this
 over-vulnerable, 'hot-housed' child inevitably becomes aware of bodily
 separateness. This is in such a sudden and painful way for it to be a
 life-threatening disaster. It is traumatic." She seems to have been
 active in UK and has good contacts with psychiatrists in USA, Italy,
 France and Spain.

 Donna explores the four years
 since her diagnosis and her attempts to leave her 'world under glass'
 and live normally.  Shows some of the distortions of perception an
 autistic person may have, and possibilities for un-learning them.  But
 hard to read without having 1st read the other book, as it refers to
 events in that book.

 Reader:  Excellent: either this or Bryna Siegel's *The World of the
 Autistic Child* would be a perfect place for a parent who's just
 heard their child's diagnosis to start; Both are very up-to-date and
 cover the whole spectrum, but Wing's book tends to cover educational
 resources in the UK rather than the US, while Siegel's in the other
 way around.
