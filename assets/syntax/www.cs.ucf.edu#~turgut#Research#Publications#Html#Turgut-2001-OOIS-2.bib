   abstract = {Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is widely used to
   represent, create, and display virtual reality objects and their environment.
   Some VRML applications require concurrent interaction by multiple users in a
   real-time distributed fashion. Such applications need a method for users to
   share and update the VRML objects in real-time. To allow concurrent shared
   real-time access, our approach is to store the VRML objects in an
   object-oriented database system (ObjectStore). In this paper, we present an
   architecture that allows multiple users to interact in a non-trivial way in
   such a shared VRML environment. We outline how the VRML world can be saved
   in ObjectStore. },
