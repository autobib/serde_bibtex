	abstract = {An ontology is a computer-processable collection of knowledge about the world. This PhD thesis explains how an ontology can be constructed and expanded auto-matically. The proposed approach consists of three contributions: 1. A core ontology, YAGO. YAGO is an ontology that has been constructed automatically. It combines high accuracy with large coverage and serves as a core that can be expanded. 2. A tool for information extraction, LEILA. LEILA is a system that can extract knowledge from natural language texts. LEILA will be used to 2nd new facts for YAGO. 3. An integration mechanism, SOFIE. SOFIE is a system that can reason on the plausibility of new knowledge. SOFIE will assess the facts found by LEILA and integrate theminto YAGO. Each of these components comes with a fully implemented system. Together,they form an integrative architecture, which does not only gather new facts,but also reconcile them with the existing facts. The result is an ever-growing,yet highly accurate ontological knowledge base. A survey of applications of theontology completes the thesis.},
