        abstract = {With the growing amount of semantic data being published on the Web the problem of finding individuals in different datasets which correspond to the same entity is gaining importance. Given that datasets are often structured using different ontologies, automatic schema-matching techniques have to be utilized before proceeding with data-level alignment. In this paper we discuss how ontology schema mis- matches influence data-level alignment based on our first experience with implementing a data fusion tool for a multi-ontology environment.}
