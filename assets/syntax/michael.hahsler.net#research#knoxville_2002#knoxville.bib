view, the problem of AI is to describe and build agents that receive percepts from the
environment and perform actions. Each such agent is implemented by a function that maps
percepts to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as
production systems, reactive agents, logical planners, neural networks, and
decision-theoretic systems.},
