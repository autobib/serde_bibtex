 abstract =    "In this paper we address the difficult problem of parameter-finding
               in image segmentation. We replace a tedious manual process, that is 
               often times based on guess-work and luck, by a principled approach
               that systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is
               the following two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling
               of the parameter space and apply a statistical model to estimate the
               response of the segmentation algorithm. The statistical model 
               incorporates a model of uncertainty of the estimation which we use in 
               conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually) guiding the user 
               towards areas that need refinement by placing additional sample 
               points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter
               space in order to determine areas where the response value (goodness
               of segmentation) is high.

               In our exploration we rely on existing ground-truth images in order
               to evaluate the 'goodness' of an image segmentation technique. We 
               evaluate its usefulness by demonstrating this technique on two image
               segmentation algorithms: a three parameter model to detect 
               microtubules in electron tomograms and an eight parameter model to 
               identify functional regions in dynamic Positron Emission Tomography 
               scans.",

 abstract =    "Many databases store data in relational format, with different
               types of entities and information about links between the entities.
               Poole introduced Parametrized Bayes nets (PBNs) as a graphical model
               for relational data. Their main use has been for first-order 
               probabilistic inference, where the goal is to predict facts about 
               individual entities. In this paper we utilize PBNs for a new task: 
               Learning class-level or first-order dependencies, which model the 
               general database statistics over attributes of linked objects and links 
               (e.g., the percentage of A grades given in computer science classes). 
               Class-level statistical relationships are important in themselves, and
               they support applications like policy making, strategic planning, and 
               query optimization. We describe efficient structure and parameter 
               learning algorithms that construct a PBN model for a given input 
               database. An evaluation of our methods on three data sets shows that
               they are computationally feasible for realistic table sizes, and that 
               the learned structures represent the statistical information in the 
               databases well. After learning compiles the database statistics 
               into a parametrized Bayes net, querying these statistics via Bayes net 
               inference is faster than with SQL queries, and does not depend on the 
               size of the database.",

 abstract =    "Image segmentation is often performed via the minimization of an energy
               function over a domain of possible segmentations. The effectiveness and 
               applicability of such methods depends greatly on the properties of the 
               energy function and its domain, and on what information can be encoded by
               it. Here we propose an energy function that achieves several important 
               goals. Specifically, our energy function is convex and incorporates shape
               prior information while simultaneously generating a probabilistic 
               segmentation for multiple regions. Our energy function represents multi-
               region probabilistic segmentations as elements of a vector space using the
               isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation. To our knowledge, these four 
               goals (convex, with shape priors, multi-region, and probabilistic) do not 
               exist together in any other method, and this is the first time ILR is used
               in an image segmentation method. We provide examples demonstrating the 
               usefulness of these features.",
