  abstract  = {Visualization of multi-dimensional data is a challenging task. The goal is not the display of multiple data dimensions, but user comprehension of the multi-dimensional data. This paper explores several techniques for perceptually motivated procedural generation of shapes to increase the comprehension of multi-dimensional data. Our glyph-based system allows the visualization of both regular and irregular grids of volumetric data. A glyph's location, 3D size, color, and opacity encode up to 8 attributes of scalar data per glyph. We have extended the system's capabilities to explore shape variation as a visualization attribute. We use procedural shape generation techniques because they allow flexibility, data abstraction, and freedom from specification of detailed shapes. We have explored three procedural shape generation techniques: fractal detail generation, superquadrics, and implicit surfaces. These techniques allow from 1 to 14 additional data dimensions to be visualized using glyph shape.}

  abstract  = {The problem of graph layout and drawing is fundamental to many approaches to the visualization of relational information structures. As the data set grows, the visualization problem is compounded by  the need to reconcile the user's need for orientation cues with the  danger of information overload. Put simply: How can we limit the  number of visual elements on the screen so as not to overwhelm the  user yet retain enough information that the user is able to navigate and explore the data set confidently?  How can we provide  orientational cues so that a user can understand the location of the  current viewpoint in a large data set?  These are problems inherent  not only to graph drawing but information visualization in general. We propose a method which extracts the significant features  of a directed acyclic graph as the basis for navigation  (Note: The color figures and a demonstration applet are  available at the web site: http://www.cwi.nl/InfoVisu).}

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new technique for 2D vector field visualization. Our approach is based on the use of a furlike texture. For this purpose, we have first developed a texture model that allows two dimensional synthesis of 3D furlike texture. The technique is based on a non stationary two dimensional AutoRegressive synthesis (2D AR). The texture generator allows local control of orientation and length of the synthesized texture (the orientation and length of filaments). This texture model is then used to represent 2D vector fields. We can use orientation, length, density and color attributes of our furlike texture to visualize local orientation and magnitude of a 2D vector field. The visual representations produced are satisfying since complete information about local orientation is easily perceived. We will show that the technique can also produce LIC-like texture. In addition, due to the AR formulation, the obtained technique is computationnally efficient.}

However, most of the time the scientist is mainly interested in the evolution of certain features. Therefore, it suffices to show the evolution of these features. The task of the visualization system is to extract the features from all frames, to determine the correspondence between features in successive frames, and finally to visualize the tracking results. This paper describes a tracking system that uses feature data to solve the correspondence problem. It tracks feature paths and determines their evolution in time. The feature data consists of basic attributes such as position, size, and mas. For each set of attributes a number of correspondence functions can be tested which results in a correspondence factor. This factor makes it possible to quantify the goodness of the match between two features in successive time frames. Since thealgorithm uses only a small data set, it is feasible to perform an extensive multi-pass search for continuing paths.}

Furthermore, a new approach is presented in order to perform particle tracing on curvilinear sparse grids. The method for curvilinear sparse grids consists of a modified Stencil Walk algorithm and especially adapted routines to compute, store, and handle the required Jacobians. The accelerating approaches are on the on hand an adaptive method, where an error criterion is used to skip basis functions subspaces with minor contribution coefficients, and on the other hand the so-called combination technique, which uses a specific selection of small full grids to emulate sparse grids.}

  abstract  = {Identifying and visualizing uncertainty together with the data is a well recognized problem. One of the culprits that introduce uncertainty in the visualization pipeline is the visualization algorithm itself. Uncertainties introduced this way usually arise from approximations and manifests themselves as artifacts in the resulting images. In this paper, we focus on comparing different direct volume rendering (DVR) algorithms and their artifacts as a result of DVR algorithm selections and their associated parameter settings. We present a new data level comparison methodology that uses differences in intermediate rendering information. In particular, we extend the traditional image level comparison techniques to include data level comparison techniques. In image level comparisons, quantized pixel values are the starting point for comparison measurements. In contrast, data level comparison techniques have the advantage of accessing and evaluating the intermediate 3D information during the rendering process. Our data level approach overcomes limitations of image level approaches and provide capabilities to compare application dependent details as well as general rendering qualities. One of the key challenges with our data level comparison approach is finding a common base for comparing the rich variety of DVR algorithms. In this paper, we present how a projection algorithm can be used as a base for comparing other DVR algorithms.In addition, a set of projection-based metrics are derived to quantify the comparison measurements among DVR algorithms. The results presented in this paper complement our earlier findings where a ray-based approach was used as the base for comparing other DVR algorithms.}

  abstract  = {In exploratory scientific visualization, isosurfaces are typically created with an explicit polygonal representation for the surface using a technique such as Marching Cubes. This surface is subsequently rendered with an attached graphics hardware accelerator such as the SGI Infinite Reality. For even moderate data sets, Marching Cubes can generate an extraordinary number of polygons, which take time to construct and to render. As the isovalue is changed, the resulting surface, and perhaps the topology, is modified making display lists impractical. Current generation of high-end graphics adapters, such as the SGI Infinite Reality, have a quoted maximum polygon rendering rate of around 10M polygons/second. However, in practice this rate is difficult to achieve primarily due to geometry traversal (appropriate display list) and pixel coverage of the polygons. As a result, when viewing isosurfaces of large, greater than 1GByte, data sets rendering becomes a bottle neck. We have recently seen the attachment of multiple graphics adapters on high-end SGI Onyx2 supercomputers. The multiple graphics pipes can be used for multiple users or they can be combined to provide a single user the power of parallel rendering. Until recently, there has not been much experimentation with this configuration for polygon rendering. To address the rendering bottleneck, we have developed a multipipe strategy for parallel rendering using a combination of CPUs and parallel graphics adaptors. The multipipe system uses multiple graphics adapters in parallel, the so called {\em SGI Onyx2 Reality Monster}. In this paper, we discuss the issues of using the multiple pipes in a Sort-Last fashion which out performs a single graphics adaptor for a surprisingly low number of polygons.}

Until recently, the additional costs imposed by time-varying data have made consideration of interactive direct volume rendering impractical.

A number of advances in computing have made this achievement possible: availability of inexpensive, high-performance I/O systems; high-bandwidth, commodity networking; commercial, microprocessor-based, shared-memory multiprocessors; and new, highly-optimized rendering algorithms.}

In this paper, we propose a new approach to accelerate volume rendering with texture mapping hardware. Based on a new volume-loading pipeline, the volume data is preprocessed efficiently before rendering. Only the volume data that contains object voxels are loaded into texture memory and resampled for rendering. Moreover, for modified classification threshold, our algorithm classifies and processes the raw volume data nearly in real time. Test show that about 40\% to 60\% rendering time is saved in our method for large volume data.}

  abstract  = {Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is a volume rendering technique which is used to extract high-intensity structures from volumetric data. At each pixel the highest data value encountered along the corresponding viewing ray is determined. MIP is commonly used to extract vascular structures from medical MRI data sets (angiography). The usual way to compensate for the loss of spatial and occlusion information in MIP images is to view the data from different view points by rotating them.As the generation of MIP is usually non-interactive, this is done by calculating multiple images offline and playing them back as an animation. In this paper a new algorithm is proposed which is capable of interactively generating Maximum Intensity Projection images using parallel projection and templates. Voxels of the data set which will never contribute to a MIP due to their neighborhood are removed during a preprocessing step. The remaining voxels are stored in a way which guarantees optimal cache coherency regardless of the viewing direction. For use on low-end hardware, a preview-mode is included which renders only more significant parts of the volume during user interaction. Furthermore we demonstrate the usability of our data structure for extensions of the MIP technique like MIP with depth-shading and Local Maximum Intensity Projection (LMIP).}

In the case of one variable, the approximation is defined by line segments; in the case of two variables, the vertices are connected to define a Delaunay triangulation of the selected subset of sites in the plane. In a second version of this algorithm, specifically designed for the bivariate case, we choose vertex sets and also change the triangulation to achieve both optimal vertex placement and optimal triangulation. We then create a hierarchy of linear spline approximations, each one being a superset of all lower-resolution ones.}

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new parallel ray-casting scheme for very large volume data on a distributed-memory architecture. Our method, based on data compression, attempts to enhance the speedup of parallel rendering by quickly reconstructing data from local memory rather than expensively fetching them from remote memory spaces. Furthermore, it takes the advantages of both object-order and image-order traversal algorithms: It exploits object-space and image-space coherence, respectively, by traversing volumes block-wise and using a run-time quadtree which is maintained dynamically against pixels' opacity values. We report experimental results on Cray T3E for the Visible Man dataset.}

Unlike software-based methods, the use of more and more available special-purpose hardware allows volume rendering at interactive frame rates - a crucial criterion for acceptance in industrial applications, e.g. CFD analysis. Careful optimizations and the exclusive use of hardware-accelerated data manipulation facilities even enable volume rendered movies supporting real time interactivity. This article presents the most important features and implementation issues of an OpenInventor-based stereoscopic, VR-featured volume rendering system for instationary datasets.}

  abstract  = {In this paper we present a method for analyzing the brain shift. The brain shift is a brain deformation phenomenon, that occurs during surgical operations on the opened head. This deformation makes navigation within the brain very difficult for the surgeon, as preoperative magnetic resonance images invalidate very quickly after the beginning of the operation. Up to now not enough is known about this deformation phenomenon in order to come up with solutions for corrective action. The aim of the tool which is presented here is to prepare ground for a better understanding by visualizing the deformation between two 3D brain data sets, where one has been taken preoperatively and the second one during the operation after the brain shift has occured. We propose a new method for the modeling of the deformation by means of efficient distance determination of two deformable surface approximations. Color coding and semi-transparent overlay of the surfaces provides qualitative and quantitative information about the brain shift. The provided insight may lead to a prediction method in future.}

This involves consideration of the geometry of the active site, determination of the geometry of the drug, and analysis of the fit between them. This problem of drug-substrate fit, often called the docking problem, can be greatly influenced by uncertainty in the position of drug side chains. Traditional molecular graphics techniques fail to capture the distribution of likely atom positions. This paper describes a range of techniques for showing atom positions as probability distributions that more completely describe parameters which determine fit.}

We enhance the visualization scalability with importance-based antialiasing techniques that guarantee visibility of several types of events. We present a hierarchical clustering method that uncovers several patterns of interest in the event logs, such as same-lifetime memory allocations and software releases. We visualize the clusters using a new type of technique called interleaved cushions. We demonstrate our methods on two real-world problems: the monitoring of a dynamic memory allocator and the analysis of a software repository.}

abstract = {Visual data analysis has received a lot of research interest in recent years, and a wide variety of new visualization techniques and applications have been developed to improve insight into the various application domains. In financial data analysis, however, analysts still primarily rely on a set of statistical performance parameters in combination with traditional line charts in order to evaluate assets and to make decisions, and information visualization is only very slowly entering this important domain. In this paper, we analyze some of the standard statistical measures for technical financial data analysis and demonstrate cases where they produce insufficient and misleading results that do not reflect the real performance of an asset. We propose a technique for visualizing financial time series data that eliminates these inadequacies, offering a complete view on the real performance of an asset. The technique is enhanced by relevance and weighting functions according to the users' preferences in order to emphasize specific regions of interest. Based on these principles we redefine some of the standard performance measures. We apply our technique on real world financial data sets and combine it with higher-level financial analysis techniques such as performance/risk analysis, dominance evaluation, and efficiency curves in order to show how traditional techniques from economics can be improved by modern visual data analysis techniques.}

abstract = {Time series are a data type of utmost importance in many domains such as business management and service monitoring. We address the problem of visualizing large time-related data sets which are difficult to visualize effectively with standard techniques given the limitations of current display devices. We propose a framework for intelligent time- and data-dependent visual aggregation of data along multiple resolution levels. This idea leads to effective visualization support for long time-series data providing both focus and context. The basic idea of the technique is that either data-dependent or application-dependent, display space is allocated in proportion to the degree of interest of data subintervals, thereby (a) guiding the user in perceiving important information, and (b) freeing required display space to visualize all the data. The automatic part of the framework can accommodate any time series analysis algorithm yielding a numeric degree of interest scale. We apply our techniques on real-world data sets, compare it with the standard visualization approach, and conclude the usefulness and scalability of the approach.}

To represent temporal changes, polygons (instead of traditional lines) are rendered in parallel coordinates. The results presented show that rendering polygons is superior at revealing large temporal changes. Both TDPC and DCPC have been efficiently implemented on the GPU allowing the visualization of thousands of data items over thousands of time steps at interactive frame rates.}

Through case studies we show how our visualization uses a hybrid layout along with varying transparency, colour, and size to reveal the lattice structure, expose the inherent uncertainty in statistical processing, and help users make better-informed decisions about statistically-derived outputs.}

abstract = {The huge amount of different automatic clustering methods emphasizes one thing: there is no optimal clustering method for all possible cases. In certain application domains, like genomics and natural language processing, it is not even clear if any of the already known clustering methods suffice. In such cases, an automatic clustering method is often followed by manual refinement. The refined version may then be used as either an illustration, a reference, or even an input for a rule based or other machine learning algorithm as a new clustering method. In this paper, we describe a novel interaction technique to manual cluster refinement using the metaphor of soap bubbles, represented by special implicit surfaces (blobs). For instance, entities can simply be moved inside and outside of these blobs. A modified force-directed layout process automatically arranges entities equidistant on the screen. The modifications include a reduction to the expected amount of computation per iteration down to O(|V| log |V|+|E|) in order to achieve a high response time for use in an interactive system. We also spend a considerable amount of effort making the display of blobs fast enough for an interactive system.}

abstract = {Grouse is a feature-based approach to steerable exploration of a graph and an associated hierarchy. Steerability allows exploration to begin immediately, rather than requiring a costly layout of the entire graph as an initial step. In a feature-based approach, the subgraph inside a metanode of the graph hierarchy is laid out with a well- chosen algorithm appropriate for its topological structure. Grouse preserves the input hierarchy, which provides meaningful information to the user when its metanodes correspond to features of interest. When a metanode in the hierarchy is opened, a limited number of metanodes are laid out again along the path between the opened node and the root. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Grouse on datasets from IMDB, the Internet Movie Database, where nodes are actors and cliques represent movies. The combination of feature-based layout and limited relayout computation does not fragment features in the hierarchy and improves the number of levels in the hierarchy that can be seen at once over previous approaches.}

Our design is visually pleasing, and also effectively displays multiple paths based on the design commonly found in metro maps. We illustrate and assess the key aspects of our design with the results obtained from two case studies and an informal user study.}

To ease the observer's access to a presented visualization result we not only communicate the result itself, but also deliver its creational process in the form of an annotated visualization animation, which we call a visualization story. Additionally, we enable variable means of interactivity during story playback. The story observers may just watch the presentation passively, but they are also allowed to reinvestigate the visualization independently from story guidance, offering the ability to verify, confirm, or even disapprove the presented visualization message. For demonstration purposes, we developed a prototype application that provides tools to author, edit, and watch visualization stories. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the basis of medical visualization examples.}

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid user interface for knowledge workers to support document spaces and corresponding visualizations. We propose a combined 2D + 3D interface to support both visualization approaches and interaction metaphors to their maximum potential. Interaction is matched due to the principle of dimensional congruence and a thorough investigation of previous approaches and problems is given. Finally, a user study to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed system is presented.}

The visualization uses a radial space-filling layout; there is a 2D mode for editing and configuration, as well as a 3D mode for exploration and overview. In addition, the 3D mode supports a simple animated &quot;fly-to&quot; command that is intended to show the user the context and trust of a particular document by zooming in on the document and its immediate neighborhood in the 3D city. The visualization is intended for integration into an existing desktop environment, connecting to the distributed file sharing mechanisms of the environment and non-obtrusively displaying a 3D orientation animation in the background for any file being accessed over the network. A formal user study shows that the technique supports significantly higher trust assignment accuracy than manual trust assignment at the cost of only a minor time investment.}

In order to analyze and understand such data, scientists need the capability to explore simultaneously in the temporal, spatial, and variable domains of the data. Such capability, however, is not generally provided by conventional visualization tools. This paper presents a new visualization interface addressing this problem. The interface consists of three components which abstracts the complexity of exploring in temporal, variable, and spatial domain, respectively. The first component displays time histograms of the data, helps the user identify timesteps of interest, and also helps specify time-varying features. The second component displays correlations between variables in parallel coordinates and enables the user to verify those correlations and possibly identity unanticipated ones. The third component allows the user to more closely explore and validate the data in spatial domain while rendering multiple variables into a single visualization in a user controllable fashion. Each of these three components is not only an interface but is also the visualization itself, thus enabling efficient screen-space usage. The three components are tightly linked to facilitate tri-space data exploration, which offers scientists new power to study their time-varying, multivariate volume data.}

The mapping from voxel attributes to optical properties is performed by transfer functions which, consequently, play a crucial role in building informative images from the data. One-dimensional transfer functions, which are based only on a scalar value per voxel, often do not provide proper visualizations. On the other hand, multidimensional transfer functions can perform more sophisticated data classification, based on vectorial voxel signatures. The transfer function design is a non-trivial and unintuitive task, especially in the multi-dimensional case. In this paper we propose a multi-dimensional transfer function design technique that uses self-organizing maps to perform dimensional reduction. Our approach gives uniform treatment to volume data containing voxel signatures of arbitrary dimension, and allows the use of any type of voxel attribute as part of the voxel signatures.}

In VS, volumes are commonly represented as a space-filling set of deformed polyhedra, which can be further decomposed into a mesh of tetrahedra for rendering. Images can then be generated via tetrahedral projection or raycasting. A current shortcoming in VS-based operations is the need for a very high level of subdivision to represent fine detail in the mesh and to obtain a high-fidelity visualization. However, we have discovered that the subdivision process itself can be closely simulated with radial basis functions (RBFs), making it possible to replace the finer subdivision levels by a coarser aggregation of RBF kernels. This reduction to a simplified assembly of RBFs subsequently enables interactive rendering of volumetric subdivision shapes within a GPU-based volume splatting framework.}

CoMIRVA is continuously being extended. Currently, it supports the following visualization techniques: Self-Organizing Map, Smoothed Data Histogram, Circled Bars, Circled Fans, Probabilistic Network, Continuous Similarity Ring, Sunburst, and Music Description Map. Since space is limited, we can only present a selected number of these in this paper.

Level set segmentation is better at boundary extraction, but either leads to global segmentation without edges, [CV01], that scales unfavorably in 3D or requires an initial estimate of the boundary from which to locally solve segmentation with edges. We propose a hybrid system in which topological analysis is used for semi-automatic initialization of a level set segmentation, and geometric information bounded topologically is used to guide and accelerate an iterative segmentation algorithm that combines several state-of-the-art level set terms. We thus combine and improve both the flexible isosurface interface and level set segmentation without edges.}

abstract = {An imaging mass spectrometer is an analytical instrument that can determine the spatial distribution of chemical compounds on complex surfaces. The output of the device is a multi-spectral datacube; a three-dimensional (3D) dataset in which the xy-dimension represents the surface position and the z-dimension represents the mass spectral distribution. Analysts try to discover correlations in spectral profiles and spatial distributions inside a datacube. New technological developments allow mass spectrometric imaging on a higher spatial and spectral resolution. In this paper we present a parametric visualization technique which allows an analyst to examine spectral and spatially correlated patterns on the highest possible resolution. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to decompose the datacube into several discriminating components. We represent these extracted features as abstract geometric shapes and use three parameters to allow for data exploration. The first parameter thresholds the spectral contribution at which an extracted component is visualized. The level of detail the shapes is controlled by a second parameter and a third parameter determines at which density-level the extracted feature is represented. This new visualization technique enables an analyst to select the most relevant spectral correlations and investigate their specific spatial distribution. With this method, less noise is included in the visualization of extracted features and by introducing various levels of detail the full spectral resolution can be utilized.}

abstract = {Vortex breakdown bubbles are a subject which is of interest in many disciplines such as aeronautics, mixing, and combustion. Existing visualization methods are based on stream surfaces, direct volume rendering, tensor field visualization, and vector field topology. This paper presents a topological approach which is more closely oriented at the underlying theory of continuous dynamical systems. Algorithms are described for the detection of vortex rings and vortex breakdown bubbles, and for visualization of their characteristic properties such as the boundary, the chaotic dynamics, and possible islands of stability. Since some of these require very long streamlines, the effect of numerically introduced divergence has to be considered. From an existing subdivision scheme, a novel method for divergence conserving interpolation of cuboid cells is derived, and results are compared with those from standard trilinear interpolation. Also a comparison of results obtained with and without divergence cleaning is given.}

abstract = {This paper introduces orthogonal vector field visualization on 2D manifolds: a representation by lines that are perpendicular to the input vector field. Line patterns are generated by line integral convolution (LIC). This visualization is combined with animation based on motion along the vector field. This decoupling of the line direction from the direction of animation allows us to choose the spatial frequencies along the direction of motion independently from the length scales along the LIC line patterns. Vision research indicates that local motion detectors are tuned to certain spatial frequencies of textures, and the above decoupling enables us to generate spatial frequencies optimized for motion perception. In addition, a filtering process is described to achieve a consistent and temporally coherent animation of the orthogonal vector field visualization. We present respective visualization algorithms for 2D planar vector fields and tangential vector fields on curved surfaces, and demonstrate that those algorithms lend themselves to efficient and interactive GPU implementations.}

abstract = {Flow vector fields contain a wealth of information that needs to be visualized. As an extension of the well-known streamline technique, we have developed a context-based method for visualizing steady flow vector fields in two and three dimensions. We call our method &quot;Priority Streamlines&quot;. In our approach, the density of the streamlines is controlled by a scalar function that can be user-defined, or be given by additional information (e.g., temperature, pressure, vorticity, velocity) considering the underlying flow vector field. In regions, which are interesting the streamlines are drawn with increased density, while less interesting regions are drawn sparsely. Since streamlines in the most important regions are drawn first, we can use thresholding to obtain a streamline representation highlighting essential features. Color-mapping and transparency can be used for visualizing other information hidden in the flow vector field.}

abstract = {We present a fast hardware-accelerated stippling method which does not require any preprocessing for placing points on surfaces. The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order to apply stippling textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our stippling technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the stippling process enables stippling for several complex objects simultaneously. We consider application scenarios in intervention planning (neck and liver surgery planning). In these scenarios, object recognition (shape perception) is supported by adding stippling to semi-transparently shaded objects which are displayed as context information.}

abstract = {This paper is concerned with a multiresolution representation for maximum intensity projection (MIP) volume rendering based on morphological pyramids which allows progressive refinement. We consider two algorithms for progressive rendering from the morphological pyramid: one which projects detail coefficients level by level, and a second one, called streaming MIP, which resorts the detail coefficients of all levels simultaneously with respect to decreasing magnitude of a suitable error measure. The latter method outperforms the level-by-level method, both with respect to image quality with a fixed amount of detail data, and in terms of flexibility of controlling approximation error or computation time. We improve the streaming MIP algorithm, present a GPU implementation for both methods, and perform a comparison with existing CPU and GPU implementations.}

We propose a novel dual-core approach to asynchronously stream such fields from the CPU, thus enabling the efficient exploration of large time-resolved sequences. This approach decouples visualization from data handling, resulting in interactive frame rates. Built upon a previously published GPU particle engine for flow visualization we have developed new strategies to compute and to visualize path lines and streak lines on the GPU. To provide additional visual cues, focus+context techniques for polygonal meshes have been integrated. The proposed techniques are used in the visual analysis of the Terashake 2.1 earthquake simulation data, and they have been shown to be very effective in revealing the relevant information in this data.}

abstract = {Synchronous electrical activity in different brain regions is generally assumed to imply functional relationships between these regions. A measure for this synchrony is electroencephalography (EEG) coherence, computed between pairs of signals as a function of frequency. Existing high-density EEG coherence visualizations are generally either hypothesis-driven, or data-driven graph visualizations which are cluttered. In this paper, a new method is presented for data-driven visualization of high-density EEG coherence, which strongly reduces clutter and is referred to as functional unit (FU) map. Starting from an initial graph, with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing significant coherences between electrode signals, we define an FU as a set of electrodes represented by a clique consisting of spatially connected vertices. In an FU map, the spatial relationship between electrodes is preserved, and all electrodes in one FU are assigned an identical gray value. Adjacent FUs are visualized with different gray values and FUs are connected by a line if the average coherence between FUs exceeds a threshold. Results obtained with our visualization are in accordance with known electrophysiological findings. FU maps can be used as a preprocessing step for conventional analysis.}

Viewpoint selection techniques enhance the display of the currently selected structure.

The influence of these parameters may be flexibly adjusted by weights. Parameter maps indicate the influence of the current parameter settings on the viewpoints. For selected applications, the weights may be predefined and reused for other cases. We also describe an informal user study which was accomplished to understand if our viewpoint selection strategies produce adequate results from the users' point of view.}

abstract = {Dense clinical data like 3D Computed Tomography (CT) scans can be visualized together with real-time imaging for a number of medical intervention applications. However, it is difficult to provide a fused visualization that allows sufficient spatial perception of the anatomy of interest, as derived from the rich pre-operative scan, while not occluding the real-time image displayed embedded within the volume. We propose an importance-driven approach that presents the embedded data such that it is clearly visible along with its spatial relation to the surrounding volumetric material. To support this, we present and integrate novel techniques for importance specification, feature emphasis, and contextual cutaway generation. We show results in a clinical context where a pre-operative CT scan is visualized alongside a tracked ultrasound image, such that the important vasculature is depicted between the viewpoint and the ultrasound image, while a more opaque representation of the anatomy is exposed in the surrounding area.}

abstract = {Expressive and efficient visualizations of complex vascular structures are essential for medical applications, such as diagnosis and therapy planning. A variety of techniques has been developed which provide smooth high-quality visualizations of vascular structures based on rather simple model assumptions. For diagnostic applications, these model assumptions and the resulting deviations from the actual vessel surface are not acceptable. We present a model-free approach which employs the binary result of a prior vessel segmentation as input. Instead of directly converting the segmentation result into a surface, we compute a point cloud which is adaptively refined at thin structures, where aliasing effects are particularly obvious and artifacts may occur. The point cloud is transformed into a surface representation by means of MPU Implicits, which provide a smooth piecewise quadratic approximation. Our method has been applied to a variety of datasets including pathologic cases. The generated visualizations are considerably more accurate than model-based approaches. Compared to other model-free approaches, our method produces smoother results.}
