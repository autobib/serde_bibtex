  abstract = {{W}e analyzed the movement of fishing vessels during fishing trips in order to understand how fishermen behave in space while searching for fi sh. {F}or that purpose we used hourly geo- referenced positions of vessels, provided by a satellite vessel monitoring system, for the entire industrial fleet ( 809 vessels) of the world's largest single species fishery ( {P}eruvian anchovy, {E}ngraulis ringens) from {D}ecember 1999 to {M}arch 2003. {O}bserved trajectories of fishing vessels are well modeled by {L}evy random walks, suggesting that. shermen use a stochastic search strategy which conforms to the same search statistics as non-human predators. {W}e show that human skills ( technology, communication, or others) do not result in the fishermen's spatial behavior being fundamentally different from that of animal predators. {W}ith respect to probability of prey encounter, our results suggest that. shermen, on average, evolved an optimal movement pattern (mu = 2.00) among the family of {L}evy random walks. {T}his {L}agrangian approach opens several perspectives in terms of operational management of the pelagic fish stock.},
