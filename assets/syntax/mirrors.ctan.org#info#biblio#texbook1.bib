%%%
%%%                        CONVENTIONS
%%%
%%%                        Books are tagged by the first author's last
%%%                        name, a colon, up to 3 upper-case letters
%%%                        taken from the first three upper-case words
%%%                        in the title (ignoring words like A, And,
%%%                        The), followed by the last two digits of
%%%                        the publication year.  If there is a volume
%%%                        entry, it is appended to the tag, prefixed
%%%                        by a hyphen.
%%%
%%%                        For Dutch authors, a van part is included
%%%                        in the author tag.  For names with accented
%%%                        letters, accents are dropped in the author
%%%                        tag.
%%%
%%%                        This scheme is systematic enough that it
%%%                        can be programmed: most of the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley book entries were created
%%%                        with an awk program from a dump of the AW
%%%                        database supplied by Mona Zeftel.  Older
%%%                        entries in this bibliography were modified
%%%                        on 28-Nov-1990 to conform to this tagging
%%%                        scheme.
%%%
%%%                        The choice of a limit of 3 letters was
%%%                        determined from experiments on the
%%%                        Addison-Wesley collection.  Long tags are
%%%                        undesirable because they are a nuisance to
%%%                        type, and also interfere with the tagged
%%%                        bibliography output produced using the
%%%                        LaTeX showtags style option.
%%%
%%%                        Journal article tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-volume-number-page, where the
%%%                        author part is the last name of the first
%%%                        author: for example,
%%%                        Gilchrist:NAMS-36-9-1199.
%%%
%%%                        Technical report tags look like
%%%                        author:abbrev-number: for example,
%%%                        Billawala:STAN-CS-89-1256.
%%%
%%%                        The Como InProceedings entries look like
%%%                        author:TEX85-page: for example,
%%%                        Agostini:TEX85-117.  Other InProceedings
%%%                        entries should follow a similar style.
%%%
%%%                        Entries are stored ordered by the BibTeX
%%%                        tag name, independent of the entry type
%%%                        (the GNU Emacs function sort-bibtex-entries
%%%                        can be used to ensure correct ordering).
%%%                        However, entries that are cross-referenced
%%%                        by others are stored at the end of the
%%%                        file, since that order is required by
%%%                        BibTeX.
%%%
%%%                        With few exceptions, value fields for
%%%                        acknowledgement, address, journal, and
%%%                        publisher keywords should use macros
%%%                        defined in the string preamble below.  This
%%%                        helps to ensure consistency, and reduces
%%%                        the entry sizes.  Address entries must
%%%                        always include the country.
%%%
%%%                        The checksum field above contains a CRC-16
%%%                        checksum as the first value, followed by the
%%%                        equivalent of the standard UNIX wc (word
%%%                        count) utility output of lines, words, and
%%%                        characters.  This is produced by Robert
%%%                        Solovay's checksum utility."

                 The publisher received camera-ready pages that were
                 prepared by the author with a 300-dpi laser printer.
                 The page style dimensions were suitably enlarged while
                 the photo plates were reduced so as to minimize the
                 granulosity of the signs. In practice the book was
                 prepared with 12pt option and reduced by the
                 photografic ratio of 0.8 so that the final real font
                 size is 9.6pt.

                 The whole book was prepared with the standard Computer
                 Roman fonts on purpose in order to show the potential
                 user what he can get witha standard \TeX{}/\LaTeX{}
                 kit. The simple pictures were prepared with the
                 ``picture'' environment. The cover and the title page
                 were designed by a graphic expert of the publishing
                 company.",

                 assistance from the production department of Academic
                 Press, Boston. The covers were done by the publisher.
                 It was typeset by the author using Plain {\TeX} plus
                 specially written macros. The code for all macros used
                 for the book are reproduced in it so that the book
                 itself contains all the information---page layout
                 specifications, fonts used, and so on---about its own
                 typesetting.

                 Over half the book consists of {\TeX} input and output
                 shown side-by-side, providing an explicit example of
                 how a part of the book was typeset.

                 The Academic Press logo on page iii, the
                 cataloging-in-publication data on page iv, and the
                 diagrams on page 33 were pasted in place by the
                 production department of Academic Press.

                 The diagrams were drawn using {\LaTeX}. Sample
                 printouts of pages were made on various laser printers.
                 When everything seemed satisfactory, the dvi files were
                 copied onto IBM diskettes and were mailed to Academic
                 Press, and from them to the American Mathematical
                 Society. The final copy was produced by the A.M.S.
                 using an APS micro-5 phototypesetter. All fonts used in
                 the book are from the Computer Modern family.

                 Parts of the covers of the book, inside and outside,
                 were done in {\TeX} by the author (the code for this is
                 not included in the book). The outside cover was
                 designed by Camille Pecoul of Academic Press and
                 produced at Allison Associates in Boston. The font used
                 for the title (on the covers) is Meridien. The
                 background pattern was obtained by shooting a handmade
                 marble paper as a black-and-white halftone and then
                 overprinting with the Pantone Matching System (PMS).
                 The placement of material on the cover was done by hand
                 by Ms. Pecoul using a mechanical board. The drop shadow
                 effect was done at Allison Associates.",

  abstract =     "For over seventy-five years the University of Chicago
                 Press `Manual of Style' has been the standard reference
                 tool for authors, editors, copywriters, and
                 proofreaders. Updated many times since 1906, it now
                 goes into its thirteenth edition---the first to
                 introduce a change in title. Bowing to what has become
                 nearly universal usage, we now call the `Manual' what
                 everybody else calls it, `The Chicago Manual of
                 Style'---or, for short, `The Chicago Manual'.\par Two
                 pervasive features characterize the present edition: it
                 reflects the impact of the new technology on the entire
                 editing and publishing process, and it spells out, in
                 greater detail and with many more examples, the
                 procedures with which it deals. It is, in short, much
                 more a ``how-to'' book for authors and editors than was
                 its predecessor. In chapter 2, on manuscript
                 preparation and copyediting, for example, new sections
                 have been added on how to mark a manuscript and how to
                 mark type specifications on a script. Chapter 12
                 (``Tables''), completely rewritten, begins with advice
                 on how to make a table from raw data. Chapters 15
                 through 17, on documentation, have been reorganized and
                 greatly expanded, offering many more alternative
                 methods of citation and a wealth of examples. In
                 chapter 18 (``Indexes''), clear step-by-step procedures
                 for the mechanics of index making are set forth. The
                 terminology and methodology of technological advances
                 (in word processing, computerized electronic
                 typesetting, and the like) are reflected most
                 prominently in chapter 20, ``Composition, Printing, and
                 Binding'' (new to this edition), and in the Glossary.
                 Other notable features of the present edition are
                 chapter 4 (``Rights and Permissions''), rewritten in
                 light of the new copyright law, and chapter 9
                 (``Foreign Languages''), which includes a new table of
                 dicritics, a pinyin (Chinese) conversion chart and data
                 on several more languages.\par Throughout, `The Chicago
                 Manual' aims to give clear and straightforward
                 guidelines for preparing and editing copy---with the
                 emphasis on the sensible, the practical, and the
                 economical. As did its predecessors, the thirteenth
                 edition of the `Manual' states the style preferences of
                 the University of Chicago Press and reflects the
                 current practices and requirements of the great
                 majority of American publishers.",

                 available hardware and software and have neglected the
                 more lasting skills needed to use these tools
                 effectively. This book has been written in response to
                 this need. It provides, in one place, a coherent and
                 accessible introduction to the principles, processes,
                 and techniques of publishing that must be understood
                 before your document production with computers and
                 laser printers can realize its full potential. \par
                 Desktop Publishing Skills introduces publishing basics,
                 such as typesetting, design, and page make-up. It is
                 independent of any specific computer or laser printer,
                 making it a more generic and permanent resource for
                 study or reference. What's more, since the entire book
                 was produced by the authors using the technologies and
                 methods described in the book, you will be able to pick
                 up additional ideas on the effective use of desktop
                 publishing by just looking at the book itself.",

                 on typesetting quality. Typesetting fundamentals are
                 explained and it is discussed why they are necessary.
                 This is done from the point of view of the professional
                 looking at the desktop publishing world.\par

                 A well written book, worth reading for laymans who are

                 \TeX{} is one of the few mentioned typesetting programs

                 the authors seem to be unaware of the underlying
                 algorithmic concepts (e.g., paragraph builder) that are
                 superior to the concepts they describe as the
                 `standard'. (FMi)\par

                 get your first article published in a technical
                 journal? Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical
                 Sciences is the book for you!

                 This handy volume provides information on virtually
                 every issue you will face when writing a technical
                 paper or talk, from choosing the right journal to
                 handling your references. You'll also get an overview
                 of the entire publication process--invaluable for
                 anyone hoping to publish in a technical journal.

                 To write a truly impressive paper, you'll need to
                 understand the anatomy of a research paper and the
                 steps involved in revising a draft. This book offers
                 discussions of these fundamental topics, along with
                 illustrative and provocative examples. Also included
                 are chapters on standard English usage, using computers
                 for writing and research, and writing technical
                 material when English is a foreign language.

                 This handbook provides much-needed advice on handling
                 the basic ingredients of a research paper, like
                 definitions, theorems, examples, and equations. In
                 addition, appendices provide essential reference
                 material, including summaries of \LaTeX{} symbols and
                 Emacs commands, addresses of mathematical societies,
                 and a list of papers that have won expository writing
                 prizes.

                 This book is ideal for graduate students and teachers.
                 Among its special features:

                 \begin{itemize} \item Detail and extensive use of
                 examples make it an excellent teaching tool

                 \item Discusses \TeX{} and other software tools for
                 preparing publications

                 \item Thorough treatment, with examples, of how to
                 write slides (transparencies) for a mathematical
                 talk.

                 \item Comprehensive index and extensive bibliography
                 make it an excellent reference

                 \item Readable for everyone in the field--from
                 undergraduates to seasoned professionals

                 decisions one line at a time, the method considers the
                 paragraph as a whole, so that the final appearance of a
                 given line might be influenced by the text on
                 succeeding lines. A system based on three simple
                 primitive concepts called ``boxes,'' ``glue,'' and
                 ``kerns'' provides the ability to deal satisfactorily
                 with a wide variety of typesetting problems in a
                 unified framework, using a single algorithm that
                 determines optimum breakpoints. This algorithm avoids
                 backtracking by a judicious use of the techniques of
                 dynamic programming. Extensive computational experience
