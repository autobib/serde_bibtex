	This paper is concerned with the complexity of proofs and of
	searching for proofs in resolution. We show that the recently
	proposed algorithm of Ben-Sasson & Wigderson for searching for
	proofs in resolution cannot give better than weakly exponential
	performance. This is a consequence of our main result: we show
	the optimality of the general relationship called size-width
	tradeoffs in Ben-Sasson & Wigderson. Moreover we obtain the
	optimality of the size-width tradeoffs for the widely used
	restrictions of resolution: regular, Davis-Putnam, negative,
	positive.
