    abstract = {This dissertation presents an integrated system for producing Natural Logic inferences,
which are used in a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks. Natural
Logic is the process of creating valid inferences by making incremental edits to natural
language expressions with respect to a universal monotonicity calculus, without
resorting to logical representation of the expressions (using First Order Logic for instance).
The system generates inferences from surface forms using a three-stage process.
First, each sentence is subjected to syntactic analysis, using a purpose-built syntactic
parser. Then the rules of the monotonicity calculus are applied, specifying the directionality
of entailment for each sentence constituents. A constituent can be either
upward or downward entailing, meaning that we may replace it with a semantically
broader or narrower term. Finally, we can find all suitable replacement terms for each
target word by using the WordNet lexical database, which contains hypernymic and
hyponymic relations.
Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar, we were able to incorporate the monotonicity
determination step in the syntactic derivation process. In order to achieve wide
coverage over English sentences we had to introduce statistical models into our syntactic
parser. At the current stage we have implemented a simple statistical model similar
to those of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars.
The system is intended to provide input to  ” deep” reasoning engines, used for
higher-level Natural Language Processing applications such as Recognising Textual
Entailment. In addition to independently evaluating each component of the system, we
present our comprehensive findings using Cyc, a large-scale knowledge base, and we
outline a solution for its relatively limited concept coverage.},
