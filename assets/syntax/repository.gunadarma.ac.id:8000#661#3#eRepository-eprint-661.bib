        abstract = {Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) is a subset of protein that plays an essential role in innate immunity system. Researches on AMP
are actively conducted in Immunology field where synthetics antibiotics are being developed. There are several classifications
of AMP?s families with different mechanism in immobilizing pathogens. Thus, family classification could help speed up a
search for specific family AMP. Efforts have been made by active bioinformaticians to build databases to gather AMP data.
However, explicit family classification is not featured in these databases due to the method they used for extracting AMP data
which is based on literature mining using keywords such as ?anticancer?, ?antibacterial? and etc. This research aimed to find
AMP family?s characteristics and method that enable us to extract AMP data based on its motif. Based on sequence signature
resulted from Multiple Sequence Alignment on known antimicrobial peptide sequences from other research work, we proposed
an Extended Boyer-Moore Algorithm (EBMA) as a method of extraction for Defensin AMP data from SWISS-PROT database.
We constructed a local data mart specifically to store data extracted by EBMA. The evaluation of this algorithm shows that it is
accurate in extracting Defensin AMP, fast and reliable.}
