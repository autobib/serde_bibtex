        abstract = {Centres for higher education are seeking to adopt online systems to improve their course presentations. The investigation of how these facilities can be beneficial to teaching and learning is essential. STILE (Students' and Teachers' Integrated Learning Environment) is a project which involved four universities in the United Kingdom. The online facilities were provided in both campus and distance-learning situations. The system used was based on the World Wide Web. However, because the Web did not comfortably facilitate conferencing in 1995, at the Open University we also adopted a proprietary conferencing system. This paper describes not only how interested the students were in the extra material provided online in both the conferencing and Web environments, but also how beneficial they felt each medium was to their learning. The tutors' perceptions of their students' participation with these online facilities is also discussed.}
