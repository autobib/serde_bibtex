  abstract =     "Any proof of P $\neq$ NP will have to overcome two
                 barriers: {\em relativization\/} and {\em natural
                 proofs}. Yet over the last decade, we have seen circuit
                 lower bounds (e.g., that PP does not have linear-size
                 circuits) that overcome both barriers simultaneously.
                 So the question arises of whether there is a third
                 barrier to progress on the central questions in
                 complexity theory.\par

                 In this article, we present such a barrier, which we
                 call {\em algebraic relativization\/} or {\em
                 algebrization}. The idea is that, when we relativize
                 some complexity class inclusion, we should give the
                 simulating machine access not only to an oracle $A$,
                 but also to a low-degree extension of $A$ over a finite
                 field or ring.\par

                 We systematically go through basic results and open
                 problems in complexity theory to delineate the power of
                 the new algebrization barrier. First, we show that all
                 known nonrelativizing results based on
                 arithmetization---both inclusions such as IP = PSPACE
                 and MIP = NEXP, and separations such as MA$_{EXP}$
                 {\SGMLnsub} P/poly---do indeed algebrize. Second, we
                 show that almost all of the major open
                 problems---including P versus NP, P versus RP, and NEXP
                 versus P/poly---will require {\em non-algebrizing
                 techniques}. In some cases, algebrization seems to
                 explain exactly why progress stopped where it did: for
                 example, why we have superlinear circuit lower bounds
                 for PromiseMA but not for NP.\par

                 Our second set of results follows from lower bounds in
                 a new model of {\em algebraic query complexity}, which
                 we introduce in this article and which is interesting
                 in its own right. Some of our lower bounds use direct
                 combinatorial and algebraic arguments, while others
                 stem from a surprising connection between our model and
                 communication complexity. Using this connection, we are
                 also able to give an MA-protocol for the Inner Product
                 function with $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ communication
                 (essentially matching a lower bound of Klauck), as well
                 as a communication complexity conjecture whose truth
                 would imply NL $\neq$ NP.",
