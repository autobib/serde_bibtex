abstract={This paper addresses the problem of image retrieval from an encrypted database, where data confidentiality is preserved both in the storage and retrieval process. The paper focuses on image feature protection techniques which enable similarity comparison among protected features. By utilizing both signal processing and cryptographic techniques, three schemes are investigated and compared, including bit-plane randomization, random projection, and randomized unary encoding. Experimental results show that secure image retrieval can achieve comparable retrieval performance to conventional image retrieval techniques without revealing information about image content. This work enriches the area of secure information retrieval and can find applications in secure online services for images and videos.},
