%X=Abstract
   This is usually for arbitrary text, in my use of it. It can contain
   lengthy material or not.  This is usually last and runs on until
   a blank line or the end of file.  It is last because it is easier to
   end an entry with the blank line that also ends the Abstract.  There
   are other ways this could work. [dh:2005-04-04T04:08Z]
      "He has put his finger on what seem some very real reasons for
Heinlein's popularity, and his book is a welcome counterweight to
some of the more negative exercises of the last few years."
   As an example of a sort of fallibility, Heinlein is alleged to
have claimed, in a conversation with Walter Cronkite, that there
is just one equation that everbody knows. Although the equation
is presumably Einstein's famous E = MC**2, the book has it
mistyped as E = EC**2 ...
%X The "Contemporary Literary Criticism" reference series,
available on the shelves of all good public libraries, provides
some interesting insight into the critical treatment of
Heinlein's work.
