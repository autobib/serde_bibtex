                  proof-theory with connections to issues of
                  complexity in the widest sense including e.g.:
                  
                  \begin{enumerate}
                  \item Strength (proof-theoretic and
                    mathematical) of subsystems of second-order
                    arithmetic and type theories. 
                  \item Type-free applicative systems (explicit
                    mathematics). 
                  \item Complexity of Proof Transformations
                    (cut-elimination, normalization,
                    epsilon-substitution etc.). 
                  \item Proofs as Programs. 
                  \item Proof Interpretations and their
                    complexity: Realizability and functional
                    interpretations, game theoretic and
                    categorical interpretations. 
                  \item Bounded arithmetic and connections to
                    complexity theory (including feasible
                    arithmetic and analysis). 
                  \item Proof Complexity of propositional proof
                    systems: resolution, Frege systems,
                    Nullstellensatz proofs etc.

  abstract = 	 "One of the most widespread programming
                  paradigms today is that of object-oriented
                  programming. With the growing popularity of the
                  language C++ and the advent of Java as the
                  language of choice for the World Wide Web,
                  object-oriented programs have taken centre
                  stage. Consequently, the past decade has seen a
                  flurry of interest within the programming
                  language research community for providing a
                  firm semantic basis for object-oriented
                  constructs.\bibpar
                  
                  Recently, there has been growing interest in
                  studying the behavioural properties of
                  object-oriented programs using concepts and
                  ideas from the world of concurrent process
                  calculi, in particular calculi with some notion
                  of mobility. Not only do such calculi, as the
                  well-known $\pi$-calculus by Milner and others,
                  have features like references and scoping in
                  common with object-oriented languages; they
                  also provide one with a rich vocabulary of
                  reasoning techniques firmly grounded in
                  structural operational semantics.\bibpar
                  
                  The process calculus view has therefore proven
                  to be advantageous in many ways for semantics
                  and verification issues. On the one hand, the
                  use of encodings of object-oriented languages
                  into existing typed mobile process calculi
                  enables formal reasoning about the correctness
                  of programs; on the other hand, using standard
                  techniques from concurrency theory in the
                  setting of calculi for objects may help in
                  reasoning about objects, e.g. by finding
                  appropriate and mathematically tractable
                  notions of behavioural equivalences. Encodings
                  may also help clarify the overlap and
                  differences of objects and processes, and
                  suggest how to integrate them best in languages
                  with both.\bibpar
                  
                  The aim of the one-day SOAP workshop, which is
                  a satellite workshop of ICALP 98, has been to
                  bring together researchers working mainly in
                  this area, but in related fields as well, where
                  other process models or calculi are used as a
                  basis for the semantics of objects.\bibpar
                  
                  Among the submitted abstracts, six were
                  recommended by the programme committee
                  (Mart{\'\i}n Abadi, Hans H{\"u}ttel, Josva
                  Kleist, and Uwe Nestmann) and are presented in
                  these proceedings. According to the more
                  informal character of the workshop, there was
                  no formal refereeing process. It is expected
                  that the abstracts presented in these
                  proceedings will appear elsewhere at other
                  conferences or in journals.\bibpar
                  
                  We would like to thank the organizers of ICALP
                  '98 for helping us set up the SOAP workshop and
                  BRICS for the publication of these

                  Tool support for the development of reliable
                  and correct computer systems is in fact of
                  growing importance: a wealth of design
                  methodologies, algorithms, and associated tools
                  have been developed in different areas of
                  computer science. However, each area has its
                  own culture and terminology, preventing
                  researchers from taking advantage of the
                  results obtained by colleagues in other fields:
                  tool builders often are unaware of, and thus
                  unable to use, work done by others. The
                  situation is even more critical when
                  considering the transfer of technology into
                  industrial practice.\bibpar
                  
                  STTT'98 addressed this situation by providing a
                  forum for discussion of all aspects of tools
                  that aid in the development of computer systems
                  in the light of a possible tool-oriented link
                  between academic research and industrial
                  practice. Accordingly, the event comprised
                  
                  \begin{itemize}
                  \item a {\bf one-day Workshop}, on {\em July
                    12th}, whose eight talks were organized in
                    three sessions: 
                    \begin{itemize}
                    \item {\em Verification of Code Generation}:
                      compiler-specific and program-specific
                      verification. 
                    \item {\em Model Checking}: variants, also
                      comprising real time aspects. 
                    \item {\em Technology Transfer}: initiatives
                      and projects.

                    the tools presented at the workshop,
