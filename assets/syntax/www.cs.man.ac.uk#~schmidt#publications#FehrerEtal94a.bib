ABSTRACT = {In this paper we focus on the application of description
logics to natural language processing.  In cooperation with the {\sc
pracma} Project ({\sc pracma} is Agents.') we have been developing a
suitably extended knowledge representation system, called {\sc motel}. 

   In our approach to agent modelling and natural language processing we
use an extension of the well-known description language $\cal ALC$.  Our
system {\sc motel}\ serves on one hand as a knowledge base for the
natural language front-end, and on the other hand, it provides powerful
{\em logical\/} representation and reasoning components.  As our
approach is logic based we hope that this enhances the overall
capabilities of the natural language processing (NLP) system.

   We present a brief overview of {\sc motel} and the different
extensions we are working on, i.e.\ modal extension of description
logics, a cardinality-based approach to quantitative information, reason
maintenance, probablistic, non-monotonic, and abductive reasoning.},
