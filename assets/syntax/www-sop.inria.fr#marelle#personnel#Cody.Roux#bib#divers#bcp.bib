abstract     =   {The research reported in this paper is concerned with
                  the problem of reasoning about properties of higher
                  order functions involving state.  It is motivated by
                  the desire to identify what, if any, are the
                  difficulties created purely by {\em locality\/} of
                  state, independent of other properties such as
                  side-effects, exceptional termination and
                  non-termination due to recursion. We consider a
                  simple language (equivalent to a fragment of
                  Standard ML) of typed, higher order functions that
                  can dynamically create fresh {\em names\/}; names
                  are created with local scope, can be tested for
                  equality and can be passed around via function
                  application, but that is all. Despite the extreme
                  simplicity of the language and its operational
                  semantics, the observable properties of such
                  functions are shown to be very subtle. A notion of
                  `logical relation' is introduced which incorporates
                  a version of {\em representation independence\/} for
                  local names. We show how to use it to establish
                  observational equivalences. The method is shown to
                  be complete (and decidable) for expressions of first
                  order types, but incomplete at higher types.}}
