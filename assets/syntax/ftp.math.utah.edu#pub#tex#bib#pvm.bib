                 achieve performance as much as twice that of the
                 fastest available Scheme compilers. Gambit is easily
                 ported, while retaining its high performance, through
                 the use of a simple virtual machine (PVM). PVM allows a
                 wide variety of machine-independent optimizations and
                 it supports parallel computation based on the future
                 construct. PVM conveys high-level information
                 bidirectionally between the machine-independent front
                 end of the compiler and the machine-dependent back end,
                 making it easy to implement a number of common back end
                 optimizations that are difficult to achieve for other
                 virtual machines. PVM is similar to many real computer
                 architectures and has an option to efficiently gather
                 dynamic measurements of virtual machine usage. These
                 measurements can be used in performance prediction for
                 ports to other architectures as well as design
                 decisions related to proposed optimizations and object

                 run time monitoring of PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine)
                 programs. PVM supports the programming of a network of
                 heterogeneous computers as a single parallel computer.
                 Using Xab, PVM programs can easily be instrumented and
                 monitored. Xab uses PVM to monitor PVM programs. This
                 makes Xab very portable but it leads to interesting
                 issues of how to make Xab peacefully coincide with the
                 programs it monitors. Xab consists of three main
                 components, a user library, a monitoring program, and
                 an X windows front end. The user library provides
                 instrumented versions of the PVM calls. The monitoring
                 program runs as a PVM process and gathers monitor
                 events in the form of PVM messages. The Xab front end
                 displays information graphically about PVM processes
                 and messages. This paper discusses the design,
                 implementation, and use of the Xab tool. Related work
                 is briefly presented and contrasted with the approach
                 taken with Xab. How Xab works and how it is used are
                 discussed in detail. Finally, the current status of Xab
                 is presented along with future directions of where the
                 research may go from here.",

                 in implementing a shared-address space programming
                 model on large-scale, distributed-memory
                 multiprocessors. While such a programming model can be
                 implemented on both shared-memory and message-passing
                 architectures, the authors argue that the transparent,
                 coherent caching of global data provided by many
                 shared-memory architectures is of crucial importance.
                 Because message-passing mechanisms are much more
                 efficient than shared-memory loads and stores for
                 certain types of interprocessor communication and
                 synchronization operations, however, the authors argue
                 for building multiprocessors that efficiently support
                 both shared-memory and message-passing mechanisms. The
                 authors describe an architecture, Alewife, that
                 integrates support for shared-memory and
                 message-passing through a simple interface; they expect
                 the compiler and runtime system to cooperate in using
                 appropriate hardware mechanisms that are most efficient
                 for specific operations. They report on both integrated
                 and exclusively shared-memory implementations of the

                 that are parallel at a coarse grain. Collections of
                 loosely-coupled, heterogeneous computers are
                 increasingly being applied to these problems. While
                 individual computers are designed to be relatively
                 reliable, a collection of several autonomous machines
                 necessarily has a greater rate of failure. As data
                 networks improve, and larger multicomputers are being
                 used, rates of failure will increase. PVM (Parallel
                 Virtual Machine) [Sun90, GS92] is a popular software
                 framework that facilitates message-passing network
                 programming. We present enhancements to PVM to mask
                 fail-stop, single-node failures from the application.
                 Fail-safe PVM uses checkpoint and rollback to recover
                 from such failures. Both checkpoints and rollbacks are
                 transparent to the application if the application does
                 not depend on real-time events. Recovery occurs without
                 wait for repair of the failed computer. The system does
                 not rely on shared stable storage and does not require
                 modifications to the operating system. We describe the
                 design and implementation of fail-safe PVM, present
                 meassurements [sic] of checkpoint costs, and briefly
                 discuss shortcomings and potential avenues for
                 improvement.'' Supported in part by the Defense

  abstract =     "The PVM Queue Manager (QM) application addresses some
                 of the load balancing problems associated with the
                 heterogeneous, multi-user, computing environments for
                 which PVM was designed. In such environments, PVM is
                 not only confronted with the difficulties of
                 distributing tasks among machines of variable loads, it
                 must also contend with machines of varying performance
                 levels in the same virtual machine. The QM addresses
                 both of these problems using two different load
                 balancing techniques, one static, the other dynamic. In
                 its simplest (static) mode, the QM will initiate PVM
                 processes for the user on demand, taking into account
                 information such as the peak megaflops/sec and actual
                 load of each machine. In addition to the initiation of
                 processes, the QM will also accept tasks to be
                 completed by a specified PVM process type. These tasks
                 are shipped to the QM where they are kept in a FIFO
                 queue. Worker processes in the virtual machine send
                 idle messages to the QM when they are ready for a task,
                 and the QM ships a task to the process if there is one
                 (of a type matching the process) in the queue. The QM
                 also maintains a list of idle processes and chooses the
                 best one for the task, should one arrive when several
                 processes are idle. Since faster machines typically
                 send more idle messages (and receive more tasks) than
                 slower ones, this provides a level of dynamic load
                 balancing for the system. Three applications have
                 already been implemented using the QM within PVM: a
                 Mandelbrot image generator, a conjugate-gradient
                 algorithm, and a map analysis program used in landscape
                 ecology applications. Benchmarks of elapsed wall-clock
                 time comparing standard PVM versions with the QM-based
                 versions demonstrate substantial performance gains for
                 both methods of load balancing. When processing a 1000
                 x 1000 image, for example, the QM-based Mandelbrot
                 application averaged 63.92 seconds, compared to 139.62
                 seconds for the standard PVM version in a heterogenous
                 [sic] network of five workstations (comprised of Sun4's
                 and IBM RS/6000).",

                 processors for providing a different style of
                 distributed operating system. Rather than providing
                 another reworking of the UNIX model, the use of the
                 large address space for unifying volatile memory
                 (virtual memory), persistent memory (file systems) and
                 distributed network access is examined and a novel
                 operating system, Arius, is proposed. The concepts
                 behind the design of Arius are briefly reviewed, and
                 then the reliability of such a system is examined in
                 detail. The unified nature of the architecture makes it
                 possible to use a reliable single address space to
                 provide a completely reliable system without the
                 addition of other mechanisms. Protocols are proposed to
                 provide locally scalable distributed shared memory and
                 these are then augmented to handle machine failures
                 transparently though the use of distributed checkpoints
                 and rollback. The checkpointing system makes use of the
                 caching mechanism in DSM to provide data duplication
                 for failure recovery. By using distributed memory for
                 checkpoints, recovery from machine faults may be
                 handled seamlessly. To cope with more ``complete''
                 failures, persistent storage is also included in the
                 failure mechanism. These protocols are modelled to show
                 their operability and to determine the cost they incur
                 in various types of parallel and serial programs.
                 Results are presented to demonstrate these costs.",

                 distributed memory. Although there are many variations,
                 the basic concept of processes communicating through
                 messages is well understood. Over the last ten years,
                 substantial progress has been made in casting
                 significant applications in this paradigm. Each vendor
                 has implemented its own variant. More recently, several
                 systems have demonstrated that a message-passing system
                 can be efficiently and portably implemented. A
                 definition of both the syntax and semantics of a core
                 of library routines is thus presented. It will be

                 would develop a mapping of data to the processor

                 what is available in memory at a given time. It can
                 also help with checkpointing. Compiler should pass info

  abstract =     "Despite improvements in network interfaces and
                 software messaging layers, software communication
                 overhead still dominates the hardware routing cost in
                 most systems. In this study, we identify the sources of
                 this overhead by analyzing software costs of typical
                 communication protocols built atop the active messages
                 layer on the CM-5. We show that up to 50-70\% of the
                 software messaging costs are a direct consequence of
                 the gap between specific network features such as
                 arbitrary delivery order, finite buffering, and limited
                 fault-handling, and the user communication requirements
                 of in-order delivery, end-to-end flow control, and
                 reliable transmission. However, virtually all of these
                 costs can be eliminated if routing networks provide
                 higher-level services such as in-order delivery,
                 end-to-end flow control, and packet-level
                 fault-tolerance. We conclude that significant cost
                 reductions require changing the constraints on
                 messaging layers: we propose designing networks and
                 network interfaces which simplify or replace software
                 for implementing user communication requirements.",

  abstract =     "This paper discusses implementations of fine-grain
                 memory access control, which selectively restricts
                 reads and writes to cache-block-sized memory regions.
                 Fine-grain access control forms the basis of efficient
                 cache-coherent shared memory. This paper focuses on
                 low-cost implementations that require little or no
                 additional hardware. These techniques permit efficient
                 implementation of shared memory on a wide range of
                 parallel systems, thereby providing shared-memory codes
                 with a portability previously limited to message
                 passing. This paper categorizes techniques based on
                 where access control is enforced and where access
                 conflicts are handled. We incorporated three techniques
                 that require no additional hardware into Blizzard, a
                 system that supports distributed shared memory on the
                 CM-5. The first adds a software lookup before each
                 shared-memory reference by modifying the program's
                 executable. The second uses the memory's error
                 correcting code (ECC) as cache-block valid bits. The
                 third is a hybrid. The software technique ranged from
                 slightly faster to two times slower than the ECC
                 approach. Blizzard's performance is roughly comparable
                 to a hardware shared-memory machine. These results
                 argue that clusters of workstations or personal
                 computers with networks comparable to the CM-5's will
                 be able to support the same shared-memory interfaces as
                 supercomputers.",

                 centers that have expensive multiprocessor computers.
                 The advantage of PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is that
                 it permits a network of heterogeneous Unix computers to
                 be used as a single large parallel computer. Thus large
                 computational problems can be solved by using the
                 aggregate power of many computers. We present some PVM
                 computational experiments of wavelet transforms in
                 image processing. Some PVM experiments were carried out

  abstract =     "This paper presents new features of PVM, a popular
                 standard for writing parallel programs that execute
                 over networks of heterogeneous machines. Although PVM
                 has become an important infrastructure for parallel
                 programmers, we continue to develop the system based
                 both on user feedback and our own research interests.
                 In this paper we present new communications routines
                 and briefly characterize their performance. We describe
                 new extensible services that allow advanced users to
                 customize certain aspects of the default PVM
                 functionality. An overview of shared-memory PVM
                 optimizations is presented. PVM's new tracing facility
                 and a graphical console that utilizes this capability
                 are described. Finally, we discuss future extensions to
                 PVM now under investigation.",

  abstract =     "Parallel computing on clusters of workstations and
                 personal computers has very high potential, since it
                 leverages existing hardware and software. Parallel
                 programming environments offer the user a convenient
                 way to express parallel computation and communication.
                 In fact, recently, a Message Passing Interface (MPI)
                 has been proposed as an industrial standard for writing
                 `portable' message-passing parallel programs. The
                 communication part of MPI consists of the usual
                 point-to-point communication as well as collective
                 communication. However, existing implementations of
                 programming environments for clusters are built on top
                 of a point-to-point communication layer (send and
                 receive) over local area networks (LANs) and, as a
                 result, suffer from poor performance in the collective
                 communication part. In this paper, we present an
                 efficient design and implementation of the collective
                 communication part in MPI that is optimized for
                 clusters of workstations. Our system consists of two
                 main components: the MPI-CCL layer that includes the
                 collective communication functionality of MPI and a
                 User-level Reliable Transport Protocol (URTP) that
                 interfaces with the LAN Data-link layer and leverages
                 the fact that the LAN is a broadcast medium. Our system
                 is integrated with the operating system via an
                 efficient kernel extension mechanism that we developed.
                 The kernel extension significantly improves the
                 performance of our implementation as it can handle part
                 of the communication overhead without involving user
                 space. We have implemented our system on a collection
                 of IBM RS/6000 workstations connected via a 10Mbit
                 Ethernet LAN. Our performance measurements are taken
                 from real scientific applications that runin a parallel
                 mode by means of the MPI. The hypothesis behind our
                 design is that system's performance will be bounded by
                 interactions between the kernel and user space rather
                 than by the bandwidth delivered by the LAN Data-Link
                 Layer. Our results indicate that the performance of our
                 MPI Broadcast (on top of Ethernet) is about twice as
                 fast as a recently published software implementation of
                 broadcast on top of ATM.",

                 accessible to users of symbolic algebra systems and to
                 users of interactive languages in general. This is done
                 by integrating MPI (Message Passing Interface), a
                 portable, parallel message-passing library, with two
                 interactive languages: GCL (GNU Common LISP), and GAP.
                 The GAP system includes a general purpose language for
                 mathematical group theory, and LISP is the basis for
                 several general-purpose symbolic algebra systems. In
                 addition, a simple master-slave abstraction is written,
                 so that end-users need not learn any of the details of
                 the MPI function calls. This work is distinct from past
                 studies in that it provides the ability to
                 interactively create, test and modify a distributed
                 environment using the original interactive language and

  abstract =     "PVM, a message-passing software system for parallel
                 processing, is used on a wide variety of processor
                 platforms, but this portability restricts execution
                 speed. The work here will address this problem mainly
                 in the context of Ethernet-based systems, proposing two
                 PVM enhancements for such systems. The first
                 enhancement exploits the fact that an Ethernet has
                 broadcast capability. Since unenhanced PVM must, to
                 keep portability, avoid using broadcast, execution
                 speed is sacrificed. In addition, the larger the
                 system, the larger the sacrifice in speed. A solution
                 to this problem is presented. The second enhancement is
                 intended for use in applications in which many
                 concurrent tasks finish at the same time, and thus
                 simultaneously try to transmit to a master process. On
                 an Ethernet, this produces excessively long random
                 backoffs, reducing program speed. An enhancement,
                 termed `programmed backoff,' is proposed.",

                 codes where two or more distinct parallel programs or
                 copies of a single program are utilized to model a
                 single problem. To support such applications, a program
                 can be divided into several single program multiple
                 data stream (SPMD) applications, each of which solves
                 the equations for a single physical discipline or grid
                 zone. These applications are bound together to form a
                 single multidisciplinary or multi-zonal program in
                 which the constituent pans communicate via
                 point-to-point message passing routines. In this report
                 it is shown that the new Message Passing Interface
                 (MPI) standard is a viable portable library for
                 implementing the message passing portion of
                 multidisciplinary applications. Further, with the
                 extension of a portable loader, fully portable
                 multidisciplinary application programs can be
                 developed. Finally, the performance of MPI is compared
                 to that of some native message passing libraries. This
                 comparison shows that MPI can be implemented to deliver
                 performance commensurate with native message passing
                 libraries.",

                 describing how parallel application might interface to
                 their environment in a portable way. We propose
                 extensions to the Message-Passing Interface (MPI)
                 Standard that provide for dynamic process management,
                 including spawning of new processes by a running
                 application and connection to existing processes to
                 support client\slash server applications. Such
                 extensions are needed if more of the runtime
                 environment for parallel programs is to be accessible
                 to MPI programs or to be themselves written using MPI.
                 The extensions proposed here are motivated by real

                 computers---the SP1*---and the largest, with 128 nodes,
                 was installed in 1993 at Argonne National Laboratory.
                 It took only days, not months, to prepare for and
                 migrate applications to this parallel supercomputer,
                 demonstrating that high performance, parallelism, and
                 portability can coexist. This paper describes the early
                 experiences with the SP1 at Argonne, which provide
                 lessons for supercomputer system designers and users
                 alike. We explore what features of software technology
                 and system architecture enabled immediate and
                 successful use of the SP1. The paper concludes with a
                 brief indication of why the move to the SP2* software
                 environment using the SP2 communication adapters, the
                 use of the emerging Message-Passing Interface standard,
                 and the continued use of the SP1 processors have been
                 successful.",

                 differential equations (PDEs) on distributed systems.
                 The platform has been implemented using PVM for a
                 network of workstations. It allows the inclusion of a
                 wide range of parameters and programming aids. The PDEs
                 are specified in the form of finite difference
                 equations. With a given set of parameters and a
                 partitioning strategy, the platform provides facilities
                 to record and predict the performance of an application
                 before running it. The performance prediction model
                 helps the user to identify the major bottlenecks of the
                 platform such that by reducing them, the speedup can be
                 improved. We also present analysis of various factors
                 that can have drastic effect on the speedup, which
                 allows the user to tune a number of parameters to

                 shared data to reduce the number of false sharing
                 misses. The algorithms analyze per-process shared data
                 accesses, pinpoint the data structures that are
                 susceptible to false sharing and choose an appropriate
                 transformation to reduce it. The transformations either
                 group data that is accessed by the same processor or
                 separate individual data items that are shared. We
                 evaluates that technique. We show through simulation
                 that our analysis successfully identifies the data

                 computational problems namely ray tracing and bottom-up
                 binary tree computing in a distributed environment. In
                 the context of ray tracing, we propose a variant of a
                 static load balancing technique presented in [15] where
                 the sampling is based on partitioning the object space.
                 Our approach partitions the image instead and uses an
                 efficient scheduling technique for load balancing.
                 Computations carried out on a binary tree arise
                 naturally in image processing and network optimization
                 problems. Many of these problems are solved efficiently
                 in parallel by the popular tree contraction technique
                 [1]. In this paper, we explore the tree-contraction
                 technique in a distributed setting using the grain
                 packing method [9]. Implementations of our algorithms
                 on a cluster of workstations using Parallel Virtual
                 Machine (PVM) [6] demonstrate near-perfect load

                 application developers have had with MPI, according to

                 integrated accident analysis capability considering
                 both reactor vessel and containment system responses.
                 This integrated package, which uses the RELAP5 and
                 CONTAIN computer codes, provides the user with greater
                 accuracy and modeling flexibility when compared with
                 accident analyses using these codes separately.
                 Multiprocessing, together with message-passing-based
                 data transfer, enables these concurrent RELAP5 and
                 CONTAIN calculations. The data transfer facilitates the
                 coupling between the reactor vessel and containment
                 portions of the calculation. The Parallel Virtual
                 Machine software system running on a network of IBM
                 RISC System\slash 6000 workstations provided the
                 multiprocessing capabilities required for this work.
                 The results of an anticipated-transient-without-scram
                 scenario for a boiling-water reactor nuclear power
                 plant are provided. For the scenario analyzed, the
                 containment temperatures and pressures that were
                 predicted on the basis of the stand-alone codes and
                 standard analysis methods were lower (i.e., less
                 conservative) than those predicted with the use of the
                 integrated code package.",

                 are connected by Ethernet. The system supplied users a
                 parallel programming environment with virtually shared
                 data objects. The KaReN was developed using the message
                 passing library PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) to have
                 good portability. To reduce overhead in maintaining
                 data coherence, several methods are introduced. The
                 request merging is introduced to reduce message
                 traffic. The copy transfer messages are also clumped
                 when possible. The weak consistency is another
                 optimization for eliminating unnecessary coherence
                 control message by allowing temporally inconsistent
                 state. This paper presents the organization and the

  abstract =     "Using a Receiver Makes it Right (RMR) data conversion
                 technique in PVM significantly improves the
                 message-passing performance in heterogeneous
                 environments. The improvements are due to two factors:
                 (1). RMR reduces the need for conversions in a
                 heterogeneous environment; (2). At most each message is
                 converted, only once compared to twice for XDR used in
                 public version of PVM, and our conversion routines are
                 streamlined and are several times faster than the XDR
                 routines. The drawback to RMR is the potential need for
                 a large number of conversion routines. We demonstrate
                 that only a small number of routines are required
                 because many vendors use the IEEE standard for data
                 representation. Given this fact, RMR may emerge as a
                 promising technique in distributed computing.",

  abstract =     "A fundamental challenge for parallel computing is to
                 obtain high-level, architecture independent, algorithms
                 which efficiently execute on general-purpose parallel
                 machines. With the emergence of message passing
                 standards such as MPI, it has become easier to design
                 efficient and portable parallel algorithms by making
                 use of these communication primitives. While existing
                 primitives allow an assortment of collective
                 communication routines, they do not handle an important
                 communication event when most or all processors have
                 non-uniformly sized personalized messages to exchange
                 with each other. We focus in this paper on the
                 h-relation personalized communication whose efficient
                 implementation will allow high performance
                 implementations of a large class of algorithms. While
                 most previous h-relation algorithms use randomization,
                 this paper presents a new deterministic approach for
                 h-relation personalized communication with
                 asymptotically optimal complexity for h>p$^2$. As an
                 application, we present an efficient algorithm for
                 stable integer sorting. The algorithms presented in
                 this paper have been coded in Split-C and run on a
                 variety of platforms, including the Thinking Machines
                 CM-5, IBM SP-1 and SP-2, Cray Research T3D, Meiko
                 Scientific CS-2, and the Intel Paragon. Our
                 experimental results are consistent with the
                 theoretical analysis and illustrate the scalability and
                 efficiency of our algorithms across different
                 platforms. In fact, they seem to outperform all similar
                 algorithms known to the authors on these platforms.",

  abstract =     "The new MEMORY CHANNEL for PCI cluster interconnect
                 technology developed by Digital (based on technology
                 from Encore Computer Corporation) dramatically reduces
                 the overhead involved in intermachine communication.
                 Digital has designed a software system, the TruCluster
                 MEMORY CHANNEL Software version 1.4 product, that
                 provides fast user-level access to the MEMORY CHANNEL
                 network and can be used to implement a form of
                 distributed shared memory. Using this product, Digital
                 has built a low-level message- passing system that
                 reduces the communications latency in a MEMORY CHANNEL
                 cluster to less than 10 microseconds. This system can,
                 in turn, be used to easily build the communications
                 libraries that programmers use to parallelize
                 scientific codes. Digital has demonstrated the
                 successful use of this message-passing system by
                 developing implementations of two of the most popular
                 of these libraries, Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and
                 Message Passing Interface (MPI).",

                 Fujitsu AP1000+ multicomputer running the AP/Linux
                 operating system. Under this environment, parallel
                 programs may be dedicated to a fixed partition, or a
                 number of parallel programs may share a partition.
                 Therefore, the MPI library has been constructed so that
                 messaging operations can be driven by polling and/or
                 interrupt techniques. It has been found that polling
                 works well when a single parallel program is running on
                 a given partition, and that interrupt-driven
                 communication makes far better use of the machine when
                 multiple parallel programs are executing. Gang
                 scheduling of multiple parallel programs which use
                 polling was found to be relatively ineffective.",

                 library software for heterogeneous computing
                 environments. Although a lot of software for
                 distributed-memory parallel computers has been written,
                 porting this software to a network of workstations
                 requires careful consideration. The symptoms of
                 heterogeneous computing failures can range from
                 erroneous results without warning to deadlock. Some of
                 the problems are straightforward to solve, but for
                 others the solutions are not so obvious, or incur an
                 unacceptable overhead. Making software robust on
                 heterogeneous systems often requires additional
                 communication. We describe and illustrate the problems
                 encountered during the development of ScaLAPACK and the
                 NAG Numerical PVM Library. Where possible, we suggest
                 ways to avoid potential pitfalls, or if that is not
                 possible, we recommend that the software not be used on
                 heterogeneous networks.",

  abstract =     "This paper explores parallel logic simulation on a
                 network of workstations using a parallel virtual
                 machine (PVM). A novel parallel implementation of the
                 centralized-time event-driven logic simulation
                 algorithm is carried out such that no global
                 controlling workstation is needed to synchronize the
                 advance of simulation time. Further advantages of our
                 new approach include a random partitioning of the
                 circuit onto available workstations and a pipelined
                 execution of the different phases of the simulation
                 algorithm. To achieve a better load balance, we employ
                 a semioptimistic scheme for gate evaluations (in
                 conjunction with a centralized-time algorithm) such
                 that no rollback is required. The performance of this
                 implementation has been evaluated using the ISCAS
                 benchmark circuits. Speedups improve with the size of
                 the circuit and the activity level in the circuit.
                 Analyses of the communication overhead show that the
                 techniques developed here will yield even higher gains
                 as newer networking technologies like ATM are employed
                 to connect workstations.",

                 critical issues. In particular, global summation and
                 dot products of distributed arrays are very susceptible
                 to rounding errors. We analyzed several accurate
                 summation methods and found that two methods are
                 particularly effective to improve (ensure)
                 reproducibility: Kahan's self-compensated summation and
                 Bailey's double-double precision summation. We provide
                 an MPI operator MPI\_SUMDD to work with MPI collective
                 operations to ensure a scalable implementation on large
                 number of processors. The final methods are
                 particularly simple to adopt in practical codes.",

  abstract =     "Parallel programs written in MPI have been widely used
                 for developing high-performance applications on various
                 platforms. Because of a restriction of the MPI
                 computation model, conventional MPI implementations on
                 shared-memory machines map each MPI node to an OS
                 process, which can suffer serious performance
                 degradation in the presence of multiprogramming. This
                 paper studies compile-time and runtime techniques for
                 enhancing performance portability of MPI code running
                 on multiprogrammed shared-memory machines. The proposed
                 techniques allow MPI nodes to be executed safety and
                 efficiently as threads. Compile-time transformation
                 eliminates global and static variables in C code using
                 node-specific data. The runtime support includes an
                 efficient and provably correct communication protocol
                 that uses lock-free data structure and takes advantage
                 of address space sharing among threads. The experiments
                 on SGI Origin 2000 show that our MPI prototype called
                 TMPI using the proposed techniques is competitive with
                 SGI's native MPI implementation in a dedicated
                 environment, and that it has significant performance
                 advantages in a multiprogrammed environment.",

                 benchmark results for low-level communication and for
                 the NAS Parallel Benchmarks to allow comparison with
                 other systems, but our primary interest is determining
                 real application performance and robustness in
                 production cluster environments. For this we use
                 PAFEC-FE, a large FORTRAN code for finite-element
                 analysis. We present results from three MPI
                 implementations, two architectures, and three
                 networking technologies (10 and 100 Mbit/s Ethernet and

                 new, SPMD and Master-Worker MPI applications on

                 completely configured as well as the node Volatility.

                 cluster of SMP architectures under OpenMP, MPI, and
                 hybrid paradigms. Traditional method of array transpose
                 needs an auxiliary array of the same size and a copy
                 back stage. We recently developed an in-place method
                 using vacancy tracking cycles. The vacancy tracking
                 algorithm outperforms the traditional 2-array method as
                 demonstrated by extensive comparisons. The independence
                 of vacancy tracking cycles allows efficient
                 parallelization of the in-place method on SMP
                 architectures at node level. Performance of
                 multi-threaded parallelism using OpenMP are tested with
                 different scheduling methods and different number of
                 threads. The vacancy tracking method is parallelized
                 using several parallel paradigms. At node level, pure
                 OpenMP outperforms pure MPI by a factor of 2.76. Across
                 entire cluster of SMP nodes, the hybrid MPI/OpenMP
                 implementation outperforms pure MPI by a factor of
                 4.44, demonstrating the validity of the parallel

                 search algorithm for the CNF Satisfiability problem.
                 Our basic strategy is to run some 10$^5$ independent
                 search paths simultaneously using PVM on a vector
                 supercomputer VPP800, which consists of 40 vector
                 processors. Using the above parallelization and
                 vectorization together with some improvement of data
                 structure, we obtained 600-times speedup in terms of
                 the number of flips the local search can make per
                 second, compared to the original GSAT by Selman and
                 Kautz. We ran our parallel GSAT for benchmark instances
                 and compared the running time with those of existing
                 SAT programs. We could observe an apparent benefit of
                 parallelization: Especially, we were able to solve two
                 instances that have never been solved before this
                 paper. We also tested parallel local search for the SAT
                 encoding of the class scheduling problem. Again we were
                 able to get almost the best answer in reasonable
                 time.",

  abstract =     "A hybrid two-level parallelism using MPI/OpenMP is
                 implemented in the general-purpose spectral/hp element
                 CFD code NekTar to take advantage of the hierarchical
                 structures arising in deterministic and stochastic CFD
                 problems. We take a coarse grain approach to
                 shared-memory parallelism with OpenMP and employ a
                 workload-splitting scheme that can reduce the OpenMP
                 synchronizations to the minimum. The hybrid
                 implementation shows good scalability with respect to
                 both the problem size and the number of processors in
                 case of a fixed problem size. With the same number of
                 processors, the hybrid model with 2 (or 4) OpenMP
                 threads per MPI process is observed to perform better
                 than pure MPI and pure OpenMP on the NCSA SGI Origin
                 2000, while the pure MPI model performs the best on the
                 IBM SP3 at SDSC and on the Compaq Alpha cluster at PSC.
                 A key new result is that the use of threads facilitates
                 effectively prefinement, which is crucial to adaptive
                 discretization using high-order methods.",

                 hierarchically structured multi-processor tasks on top
                 of SPMD tasks for distributed memory machines. The
                 parallel execution requires a corresponding
                 decomposition of the set of processors into a
                 hierarchical group structure onto which the tasks are
                 mapped. This results in a multi-level group SPMD
                 computation model with varying processor group
                 structures. The advantage of this kind of mixed task
                 and data parallelism is a potential to reduce the
                 communication overhead and to increase scalability. We
                 present a runtime library to support the coordination
                 of hierarchically structured multi-processor tasks. The
                 library exploits an extended parallel group SPMD
                 programming model and manages the entire task execution
                 including the dynamic hierarchy of processor groups.
                 The library is built on top of MPI, has an easy-to-use
                 interface, and leads to only a marginal overhead while
                 allowing static planning and dynamic restructuring.

                 multiprocessor tasks, multilevel group SPMD,

                 cluster. The network adapter exports a remote shared
                 memory (RSM) model that supports low latency kernel
                 bypass messaging. The Sun\TM{} MPI library uses the RSM
                 interface to implement a highly efficient
                 memory-to-memory messaging protocol in which the
                 library directly manages buffers and data structures in
                 remote memory. This allows flexible allocation of
                 buffer space to active connections, while avoiding
                 resource contention that could otherwise increase

  abstract =     "The topology functionality of the Message Passing
                 Interface (MPI) provides a portable,
                 architecture-independent means for adapting application
                 programs to the communication architecture of the
                 target hardware. However, current MPI implementations
                 rarely go beyond the most trivial implementation, and
                 simply performs no process remapping. We discuss the
                 potential of the topology mechanism for systems with a
                 hierarchical communication architecture like clusters
                 of SMP nodes. The MPI topology functionality is a weak
                 mechanism, and we argue about some of its shortcomings.
                 We formulate the topology optimization problem as a
                 graph embedding problem, and show that for hierarchical
                 systems it can be solved by graph partitioning. We
                 state the properties of a new heuristic for solving
                 both the embedding problem and the ``easier'' graph
                 partitioning problem. The graph partitioning based
                 framework has been fully implemented in MPI/SX for the
                 NEC SX-series of parallel vector computers. MPI/SX is
                 thus one of very few MPI implementations with a
                 non-trivial topology functionality. On a 4 node NEC
                 SX-6 significant communication performance improvements
                 are achieved with synthetic MPI benchmarks.",

  abstract =     "Performance analysis of communication activity for a
                 terascale application with traditional message tracing
                 can be overwhelming in terms of overhead, perturbation,
                 and storage. We propose a novel alternative that
                 enables dynamic statistical profiling of an
                 application's communication activity using message
                 sampling. We have implemented an operational prototype,
                 named PHOTON, and our evidence shows that this new
                 approach can provide an accurate, low-overhead,
                 tractable alternative for performance analysis of
                 communication activity. PHOTON consists of two
                 components: a Message Passing Interface (MPI) profiling
                 layer that implements sampling and analysis, and a
                 modified MPI runtime that appends a small but necessary
                 amount of information to individual messages. More
                 importantly, this alternative enables an assortment of
                 runtime analysis techniques so that, in contrast to
                 post-mortem, trace-based techniques, the raw
                 performance data can be jettisoned immediately after
                 analysis. Our investigation shows that message sampling
                 can reduce overhead to imperceptible levels for many
                 applications. Experiments on several applications
                 demonstrate the viability of this approach. For
                 example, with one application, our technique reduced
                 the analysis overhead from 154\% for traditional
                 tracing to 6\% for statistical profiling. We also
                 evaluate different sampling techniques in this
                 framework. The coverage of the sample space provided by
                 purely random sampling is superior to counter- and
                 timer-based sampling. Also, PHOTON's design reveals
                 that frugal modifications to the MPI runtime system
                 could facilitate such techniques on production
                 computing systems, and it suggests that this sampling
                 technique could execute continuously for long-running
                 applications.",

                 tracing instrumentation for both communication and
                 computation. Based on these measurements, we refine our

                 influence performance and scalability for each
                 application; we distill these factors into common
                 traits and overall recommendations for both users and
                 designers of scalable platforms. Our experiments
                 demonstrate that some traits, such as improvements in
                 the scaling and performance of MPI's collective
                 operations, will benefit most applications. We also
                 find specific characteristics of some applications that
                 limit performance. For example, one application's
                 intensive use of a 64-bit, floating-point divide
                 instruction, which has high latency and is not

                 motivates the use of fault tolerant MPI
                 implementations. We present MPICH-V2 (the second
                 protocol of MPICHV project), an automatic fault
                 tolerant MPI implementation using an innovative
                 protocol that removes the most limiting factor of the
                 pessimistic message logging approach: reliable logging
                 of in transit messages. MPICH-V2 relies on
                 uncoordinated checkpointing, sender based message
                 logging and remote reliable logging of message logical
                 clocks. This paper presents the architecture of
                 MPICH-V2, its theoretical foundation and the
                 performance of the implementation. We compare MPICH-V2
                 to MPICH-V1 and MPICH-P4 evaluating (a) its
                 point-to-point performance, (b) the performance for the
                 NAS benchmarks, (c) the application performance when
                 many faults occur during the execution. Experimental
                 results demonstrate that MPICH-V2 provides performance
                 close to MPICH-P4 for applications using large messages
                 while reducing dramatically the number of reliable
                 nodes compared to MPICH-V1.",

                 optimal hardware-based multicast trees, on networks
                 that provide hardware support for collective
                 communication. Although the proposed methodology can be
                 generalized to a wide class of networks, we apply our
                 methodology to the Quadrics network, a state-of-the-art
                 network that provides hardware-based multicast
                 communication. The proposed mechanism is intended to
                 improve the performance of the collective communication
                 patterns on the network, in those cases where the
                 hardware support can not be directly used, for
                 instance, due to some faulty nodes. This scheme
                 provides significant reduction on multicast latencies
                 compared to the original system primitives, which use
                 multicast trees based on unicast communication. A
                 backtracking algorithm to find the optimal solution to
                 the problem is presented. In addition, a greedy
                 algorithm is presented and shown to provide near
                 optimal solutions. Finally, our experimental results
                 show the good performance and scalability of the
                 proposed multicast tree in comparison to the
                 traditional unicast-based multicast trees. Our
                 multicast mechanism doubles barrier synchronization and
                 broadcasts performance when compared to the
                 production-level MPI library.",

                 approach to design the communication layer for
                 large-scale parallel machines. The emphasis of BCS-MPI
                 is on the global coordination of a large number of
                 communicating processes rather than on the traditional
                 optimization of the point-to-point performance. BCS-MPI
                 delays the interprocessor communication in order to
                 schedule globally the communication pattern and it is
                 designed on top of a minimal set of collective
                 communication primitives. In this paper we describe a
                 prototype implementation of BCS-MPI and its
                 communication protocols. Several experimental results,
                 executed on a set of scientific applications, show that
                 BCS-MPI can compete with a production-level MPI
                 implementation, but is much simpler to implement, debug
                 and model. Keywords: MPI, buffered coscheduling, STORM,

  abstract =     "Demand for programming environments to exploit
                 clusters of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) is
                 increasing. In this paper, we present a new programming
                 environment, called ParADE, to enable easy, portable,
                 and high-performance programming on SMP clusters. It is
                 an OpenMP programming environment on top of a
                 multi-threaded software distributed shared memory
                 (SDSM) system with a variant of home-based lazy release
                 consistency protocol. To boost performance, the runtime
                 system provides explicit message-passing primitives to
                 make it a hybrid-programming environment. Collective
                 communication primitives are used for the
                 synchronization and work-sharing directives associated
                 with small data structures, lessening the
                 synchronization overhead and avoiding the implicit
                 barriers of work-sharing directives. The OpenMP
                 translator bridges the gap between the OpenMP
                 abstraction and the hybrid programming interfaces of
                 the runtime system. The experiments with several NAS
                 benchmarks and applications on a Linux-based cluster
                 show promising results that ParADE overcomes the
                 performance problem of the conventional SDSM-based
                 OpenMP environment.",

                 spectral-element method, a high-degree finite-element
                 technique with an exactly diagonal mass matrix. We use
                 a very large mesh with 5.5 billion grid points (14.6
                 billion degrees of freedom). We include the full
                 complexity of the Earth, i.e., a three-dimensional
                 wave-speed and density structure, a 3-D crustal model,
                 ellipticity as well as topography and bathymetry. A
                 total of 2.5 terabytes of memory is needed. Our
                 implementation is purely based upon MPI, with loop
                 vectorization on each processor. We obtain an excellent
                 vectorization ratio of 99.3\%, and we reach a
                 performance of 5 teraflops (30\% of the peak
                 performance) on 38\% of the machine. The very high
                 resolution of the mesh allows us to perform fully

                 programming interface, which is popular in numerous
                 scientific application domains. However, the original

                 present a new parallel interface for writing and

                 minimal changes from the serial netCDF interface but
                 defines semantics for parallel access and is tailored
                 for high performance. The underlying parallel I/O is
                 achieved through MPI-IO, allowing for substantial
                 performance gains through the use of collective I/O
                 optimizations. We compare the implementation strategies

                 consists of two major parts. The first part consists of
                 a set of MPI level micro-benchmarks that characterize
                 different aspects of MPI implementations. The second
                 part of the performance evaluation consists of
                 application level benchmarks. We have used the NAS
                 Parallel Benchmarks and the sweep3D benchmark. We not
                 only present the overall performance results, but also
                 relate application communication characteristics to the
                 information we acquired from the micro-benchmarks. Our
                 results show that the three MPI implementations all
                 have their advantages and disadvantages. For our 8-node
                 cluster, InfiniBand can offer significant performance
                 improvements for a number of applications compared with
                 Myrinet and Quadrics when using the PCI-X bus. Even
                 with just the PCI bus, InfiniBand can still perform

                 collectives. In response, researchers have designed
                 algorithms considering a range of parameters including
                 data size, system size, and communication
                 characteristics. Throughout this past work, however,
                 processing was limited to the host CPU. Today, modern
                 Network Interface Cards (NICs) sport programmable
                 processors with substantial memory, and thus introduce
                 a fresh variable into the equation. In this paper, we
                 investigate this new option in the context of
                 large-scale clusters. Through experiments on the
                 960-node, 1920-processor ASCI Linux Cluster (ALC) at
                 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, we show that
                 NIC-based reductions outperform host-based algorithms
                 in terms of reduced latency and increased consistency.
                 In particular, in the largest configuration tested ---
                 1812 processors --- our NIC-based algorithm summed
                 single-element vectors of 32-bit integers and 64-bit
                 floating-point numbers in 73 $\mu$s and 118 $\mu$s,
                 respectively. These results represent respective
                 improvements of 121\% and 39\% over the

                 This method is based on a three-level hybrid parallel

                 contact conditions performed on the Earth Simulator.

                 implementing efficient distributed-memory parallel
                 programs. The problem becomes more difficult in
                 environments where the participating nodes are not
                 dedicated to a parallel application. We are
                 investigating the data distribution problem in non
                 dedicated environments in the context of explicit
                 message-passing programs.\par

                 To address this problem, we have designed and
                 implemented an extension to MPI called Dynamic MPI
                 (Dyn-MPI). The key component of Dyn-MPI is its run-time
                 system, which efficiently and automatically
                 redistributes data on the fly when there are changes in
                 the application or the underlying environment. Dyn-MPI
                 supports efficient memory allocation, precise
                 measurement of system load and computation time, and
                 node removal. Performance results show that programs
                 that use Dyn-MPI execute efficiently in non dedicated
                 environments, including up to almost a three-fold
                 improvement compared to programs that do not

  abstract =     "Many applications of parallel I/O perform
                 non-contiguous file accesses: instead of accessing a
                 single (large) block of data in a file, a number of
                 (smaller) blocks of data scattered throughout the file
                 needs to be accessed in each logical I/O operation.
                 However, only few file system interfaces directly
                 support this kind of non-contiguous file access. In
                 contrast, the most commonly used parallel programming
                 interface, MPI, incorporates a flexible model of
                 parallel I/O through its MPI-IO interface. With MPI-IO,
                 arbitrary non-contiguous file accesses are supported in
                 a uniform fashion by the use of derived MPI datatypes
                 set up by the user to reflect the desired I/O
                 pattern.\par

                 Despite a considerable amount of recent work in this
                 area, current MPI-IO implementations suffer from low
                 performance of such non-contiguous accesses when
                 compared to the performance of the storage system for
                 contiguous accesses. In this paper we analyze an
                 important bottleneck in the efficient handling of
                 non-contiguous access patterns in current
                 implementations of MPIIO. We present a new technique,
                 termed listless I/O, that can be incorporated into
                 MPI-IO implementations like the well-known ROMIO
                 implementation, and completely eliminates this
                 bottleneck. We have implemented the technique in
                 MPI/SX, the MPI implementation for the NEC SX-series of
                 parallel vector computers. Results with a synthetic
                 benchmark and an application kernel show that listless
                 I/O is able to increase the bandwidth for
                 non-contiguous file access by sometimes more than a
                 factor of 500 when compared to the traditional
                 approach.",

  abstract =     "We present a new adaptive fast multipole algorithm and
                 its parallel implementation. The algorithm is
                 kernel-independent in the sense that the evaluation of
                 pairwise interactions does not rely on any analytic
                 expansions, but only utilizes kernel evaluations. The
                 new method provides the enabling technology for many
                 important problems in computational science and
                 engineering. Examples include viscous flows, fracture
                 mechanics and screened Coulombic interactions. Our
                 MPI-based parallel implementation logically separates
                 the computation and communication phases to avoid
                 synchronization in the upward and downward computation
                 passes, and thus allows us to fully exploit computation
                 and communication overlapping. We measure isogranular
                 and fixed-size scalability for a variety of kernels on
                 the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's TCS-1
                 AlphaServer on up to 3000 processors. We have solved
                 viscous flow problems with up to 2.1 billion unknowns
                 and we have achieved 1.6 Tflops/s peak performance and
                 1.13 Tflops/s sustained performance.",

  abstract =     "In many projects the true costs of high performance
                 computing are currently dominated by software.
                 Addressing these costs may require shifting to higher
                 level languages such as Matlab. MatlabMPI is a Matlab
                 implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
                 standard and allows any Matlab program to exploit
                 multiple processors. MatlabMPI currently implements the
                 basic six functions that are the core of the MPI
                 point-to-point communications standard. The key
                 technical innovation of MatlabMPI is that it implements
                 the widely used MPI ``look and feel'' on top of
                 standard Matlab file I/O, resulting in an extremely
                 compact ($\approx 350$ lines of code) and ``pure''
                 implementation which runs anywhere Matlab runs, and on
                 any heterogeneous combination of computers. The
                 performance has been tested on both shared and
                 distributed memory parallel computers (e.g. Sun, SGI,
                 HP, IBM, Linux, MacOSX and Windows). MatlabMPI can
                 match the bandwidth of C based MPI at large message
                 sizes. A test image filtering application using
                 MatlabMPI achieved a speedup of $\approx300$ using 304
                 CPUs and $\approx15\%$ of the theoretical peak (450
                 Gigaflops) on an IBM SP2 at the Maui High Performance
                 Computing Center. In addition, this entire parallel
                 benchmark application was implemented in 70
                 software-lines-of-code, illustrating the high
                 productivity of this approach. MatlabMPI is available
                 for download on the web (www.ll.mit.edu/MatlabMPI).",

  abstract =     "In a distributed environment, materialized views are
                 used to integrate data from different information
                 sources and then store them in some centralized
                 location. In order to maintain such materialized views,
                 maintenance queries need to be sent to information
                 sources by the data warehouse management system. Due to
                 the independence of the information sources and the
                 data warehouse, concurrency issues are raised between
                 the maintenance queries and the local update
                 transactions at each information source. Recent
                 solutions such as ECA and Strobe tackle such concurrent
                 maintenance, however with the requirement of quiescence
                 of the information sources. SWEEP and POSSE overcome
                 this limitation by decomposing the global maintenance
                 query into smaller subqueries to be sent to every
                 information source and then performing conflict
                 correction locally at the data warehouse. Note that all
                 these previous approaches handle the data updates {\em
                 one at a time}. Hence either some of the information
                 sources or the data warehouse is likely to be idle
                 during most of the maintenance process. In this paper,
                 we propose that a set of updates should be maintained
                 in parallel by several concurrent maintenance processes
                 so that both the information sources as well as the
                 warehouse would be utilized more fully throughout the
                 maintenance process. This parallelism should then
                 improve the overall maintenance performance. For this
                 we have developed a parallel view maintenance
                 algorithm, called PVM, that substantially improves upon
                 the performance of previous maintenance approaches by
                 handling a set of data updates at the same time. The
                 parallel handling of a set of updates is orthogonal to
                 the particular maintenance algorithm applied to the
                 handling of each individual update. In order to perform
                 parallel view maintenance, we have identified two
                 critical issues that must be overcome: (1) detecting
                 maintenance-concurrent data updates in a parallel mode
                 and (2) correcting the problem that the data warehouse
                 commit order may not correspond to the data warehouse
                 update processing order due to parallel maintenance
                 handling. In this work, we provide solutions to both
                 issues. For the former, we insert a middle-layer
                 timestamp assignment module for detecting
                 maintenance-concurrent data updates without requiring
                 any global clock synchronization. For the latter, we
                 introduce the negative counter concept to solve the
                 problem of variant orders of committing effects of data
                 updates to the data warehouse. We provide a proof of
                 the correctness of PVM that guarantees that our
                 strategy indeed generates the correct final data
                 warehouse state. We have implemented both SWEEP and PVM
                 in our EVE data warehousing system. Our performance
                 study demonstrates that a manyfold performance
                 improvement is achieved by PVM over SWEEP.",

  abstract =     "The Blue Gene/L (BG/L) supercomputer, with 65,536
                 dual-processor compute nodes, was designed from the
                 ground up to support efficient execution of massively
                 parallel message-passing programs. Part of this support
                 is an optimized implementation of the Message Passing
                 Interface (MPI), which leverages the hardware features
                 of BG/L. MPI for BG/L is implemented on top of a more
                 basic message-passing infrastructure called the message
                 layer. This message layer can be used both to implement
                 other higher-level libraries and directly by
                 applications. MPI and the message layer are used in the
                 two BG/L modes of operation: the coprocessor mode and
                 the virtual node mode. Performance measurements show
                 that our message-passing services deliver performance
                 close to the hardware limits of the machine. They also
                 show that dedicating one of the processors of a node to
                 communication functions (coprocessor mode) greatly
                 improves the message-passing bandwidth, whereas running
                 two processes per compute node (virtual node mode) can
                 have a positive impact on application performance.",

  abstract =     "A general method for optimizing problem layout on the
                 Blue Gene/L (BG/L) supercomputer is described. The
                 method takes as input the communication matrix of an
                 arbitrary problem as an array with entries $C(i, j)$,
                 which represents the data communicated from domain $i$
                 to domain $j$. Given $C(i, j)$, we implement a
                 heuristic map that attempts to sequentially map a
                 domain and its communication neighbors either to the
                 same BG/L node or to near-neighbor nodes on the BG/L
                 torus, while keeping the number of domains mapped to a
                 BG/L node constant. We then generate a Markov chain of
                 maps using Monte Carlo simulation with free energy $F =
                 \sum_{i,j} C(i, j)H(i, j)$, where $H(i, j)$ is the
                 smallest number of hops on the BG/L torus between
                 domain $i$ and domain $j$. For two large parallel
                 applications, SAGE and UMT2000, the method was tested
                 against the default Message Passing Interface rank
                 order layout on up to 2,048 BG/L nodes. It produced
                 maps that improved communication efficiency by up to
                 45\%.",

                 2,048-node Blue Gene/L (BG/L) prototype. Two
                 implementations of the volumetric FFT algorithm were

  abstract =     "An $\Theta(n)$ parallel multigrid summation method
                 (MG) for the N-body problem is presented. The method
                 was originally devised for vacuum boundary conditions.
                 Here, it is extended to periodic boundary conditions
                 and implemented in parallel using force decomposition
                 and MPI. MG is based on a hierarchical decomposition of
                 computational kernels on multiple grids. For low
                 accuracy calculations, appropriate for molecular
                 dynamics, a sequential implementation is as fast or
                 faster than particle mesh Ewald (PME). Our parallel
                 implementation is more scalable than PME. The method
                 can be combined with multiple time stepping integrators
                 to produce a powerful simulation protocol for
                 simulation of biological molecules and other materials.
                 The parallel implementation is tested on both a Linux
                 cluster with Myrinet interconnect and a shared memory
                 computer. It is available as open-source at
                 http://protomol.sourceforge.net. An auxiliary tool
                 allows the automatic selection of optimal parameters
                 for MG, and is available at
                 http://mdsimaid.cse.nd.edu.",

                 a parallel computer. The key innovation of MatlabMPI is
                 that it implements the widely used MPI ``look and
                 feel'' on top of standard Matlab file i/o, resulting in
                 a ``pure'' Matlab implementation that is exceedingly
                 small (about 300 lines of code). Thus, MatlabMPI will
                 run on any combination of computers that Matlab
                 supports. In addition, because of its small size, it is
                 simple to download and use (and modify if you like).",

                 performance analysis tools for the new Blue Gene/L
                 supercomputer. Those tools can be divided into two
                 categories: single-node performance tools and multinode
                 performance tools. From a single-node perspective, we
                 provide standard interfaces and libraries, such as PAPI
                 and libHPM, that provide access to the hardware
                 performance counters for applications running on the
                 Blue Gene/L compute nodes. From a multinode
                 perspective, we focus on tools that analyze Message
                 Passing Interface (MPI) behavior. Those tools work by
                 first collecting message-passing trace data when a
                 program runs. The trace data is then used by graphical
                 interface tools that analyze the behavior of
                 applications. Using the current prototype tools, we
                 demonstrate their usefulness and applicability with
                 case studies of application optimization.",

                 newly installed NASA Columbia supercomputer. These
                 packages include both a high-fidelity, unstructured,
                 Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes solver, and a
                 fully-automated inviscid flow package for cut-cell
                 Cartesian grids. The complementary combination of these
                 two simulation codes enables high-fidelity
                 characterization of aerospace vehicle design
                 performance over the entire flight envelope through
                 extensive parametric analysis and detailed simulation
                 of critical regions of the flight envelope. Both
                 packages are industrial-level codes designed for
                 complex geometry and incorporate customized multigrid
                 solution algorithms. The performance of these codes on
                 Columbia is examined using both MPI and OpenMP and
                 using both the NUMAlink and InfiniBand interconnect
                 fabrics. Numerical results demonstrate good scalability
                 on up to 2016 cpus using the NUMAlink4 interconnect,
                 with measured computational rates in the vicinity of 3
                 TFLOP/s, while InfiniBand showed some performance
                 degradation at high CPU counts, particularly with
                 multigrid. Nonetheless, the results are encouraging
                 enough to indicate that larger test cases using
                 combined MPI/OpenMP communication should scale well on
                 even more processors.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes the design and implementation of
                 a scalable run-time system and an optimizing compiler
                 for Unified Parallel C (UPC). An experimental
                 evaluation on BlueGene/L{\reg}, a distributed-memory
                 machine, demonstrates that the combination of the
                 compiler with the runtime system produces programs with
                 performance comparable to that of efficient MPI
                 programs and good performance scalability up to
                 hundreds of thousands of processors. Our runtime system
                 design solves the problem of maintaining shared object
                 consistency efficiently in a distributed memory
                 machine. Our compiler infrastructure simplifies the
                 code generated for parallel loops in UPC through the
                 elimination of affinity tests, eliminates several
                 levels of indirection for accesses to segments of
                 shared arrays that the compiler can prove to be local,
                 and implements remote update operations through a
                 lower-cost asynchronous message. The performance
                 evaluation uses three well-known benchmarks --- HPC
                 RandomAccess, HPC STREAM and NAS CG --- to obtain
                 scaling and absolute performance numbers for these
                 benchmarks on up to 131072 processors, the full
                 BlueGene/L machine. These results were used to win the
                 HPC Challenge Competition at SC05 in Seattle WA,
                 demonstrating that PGAS languages support both
                 productivity and performance.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents our experience mapping OpenMP
                 parallel programming model to the IBM Cyclops-64 (C64)
                 architecture. The C64 employs a many-core-on-a-chip
                 design that integrates processing logic (160 thread
                 units), embedded memory (5MB) and communication
                 hardware on the same die. Such a unique architecture
                 presents new opportunities for optimization.
                 Specifically, we consider the following three areas:
                 (1) a memory aware runtime library that places
                 frequently used data structures in scratchpad memory;
                 (2) a unique spin lock algorithm for shared memory
                 synchronization based on in-memory atomic instructions
                 and native support for thread level execution; (3) a
                 fast barrier that directly uses C64 hardware support
                 for collective synchronization. All three optimizations
                 together, result in an 80\% overhead reduction for
                 language constructs in OpenMP. We believe that such a
                 drastic reduction in the cost of managing parallelism
                 makes OpenMP more amenable for writing parallel
                 programs on the C64 platform.",

  abstract =     "One of the major new features in the Fortran 2003 is
                 features for interoperability with C Interop). The
                 intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING provides: * constants,
                 mostly type parameters, C_NULL_CHAR, C_NULL_PTR, and
                 others, * types, and in particular, TYPE(C_PTR) and
                 TYPE(C_FUNPTR), * procedures, such as C_LOC, C_FUNLOC,
                 C_F_POINTER, C_F_PROCPOINTER and C_ASSOCIATED. A
                 Fortran interface can be specified for a C function
                 with external linkage and used to invoke such a
                 function. The interface has the characteristic BIND(C)
                 label, and must also satisfy some additional
                 restrictions. C Interop can be used to portably use
                 multi-language codes in Fortran. Since most languages
                 interoperate with C, the feature can actually be used
                 to interoperate with other programming languages as
                 well. C Interop can also be used to give access to
                 Fortran programmers to the many standard libraries with
                 widely-used and implemented C interfaces. This includes
                 lower-level tasks such as interfacing with the OS on
                 UNIX-based systems, or using special libraries like
                 OpenGL. For simple API's, developing Fortran interfaces
                 is practically trivial once one gets some experience.
                 For more complicated API's whose full
                 functionality/power is not needed, such as for example
                 TCP/IP sockets or shared-memory segments on UNIX
                 systems, it is often easier to develop a condensed C
                 API/library that does the actual work, and is simpler
                 to interface to from Fortran. However, for libraries
                 like OpenGL, one should provide a full Fortran
                 interface so that the whole API can be accessed. Doing
                 this manually is not easy and is also error-prone due
                 to the size of the OpenGL/GLU/GLUT interfaces. For
                 certain libraries like MPI, a special Fortran interface
                 may be defined for the purposes of efficiency,
                 portability, ease-of-use, or to accommodate for
                 language semantic differences. In this first paper, we
                 will show how to develop a Fortran interface for a
                 simple C API/library. In a second paper, we consider
                 automating the process so that large and more complex
                 API's, and in particular, OpenGL, can be handled. The
                 source codes can be obtained at
                 http://atom.princeton.edu/donev/F2x.Along the way, we
                 identify some problems with the design of C Interop in
                 Fortran 2003.",

                 must discard threads as a programming model.
                 Nondeterminism should be judiciously and carefully
                 introduced where needed, and it should be explicit in
                 programs. In general-purpose software engineering
                 practice, we have reached a point where one approach to
                 concurrent programming dominates all others namely,
                 threads, sequential processes that share memory. They
                 represent a key concurrency model supported by modern
                 computers, programming languages, and operating
                 systems. In scientific computing, where performance
                 requirements have long demanded concurrent programming,
                 data-parallel language extensions and message-passing
                 libraries such as PVM, MPI, and OpenMP dominate over

  abstract =     "This paper discusses a template-based approach to aid
                 in introducing the upper-division undergraduate (or
                 first year graduate) to the rapidly emerging message
                 passing parallel computing paradigm. Our template
                 library facilitates an accelerated MPI programming
                 learning environment that can realistically be included
                 as one topic among many in an algorithms course. One
                 template module is based on a backtracking solution to
                 the satisfiability problem (SAT), which the student
                 first solves in the sequential setting. With the aid of
                 a modified template, the student then develops a simple
                 parallel SAT solver. The template includes such things
                 as I/O functions, allowing the student to focus on the
                 algorithm itself. The parallel part is partially
                 provided by the template, with indicators given in
                 places where the student needs to plug in missing MPI
                 function calls. The students are excited about this
                 hands-on-experience in the increasingly important world
                 of message passing parallel computing, which might be
                 missed if their curriculum does not include a course
                 devoted to this topic.",

                 have proven to be very effective for finding all the
                 isolated solutions to polynomial systems of equations.
                 After many years of development, homotopy path trackers
                 based on probability-one homotopy methods are reliable
                 and fast. Now, theoretical advances reducing the number
                 of homotopy paths that must be tracked and handling
                 singular solutions have made probability-one homotopy
                 methods even more practical. POLSYS\_GLP consists of
                 Fortran 95 modules for finding all isolated solutions
                 of a complex coefficient polynomial system of
                 equations. The package is intended to be used on a
                 distributed memory multiprocessor in conjunction with
                 HOMPACK90 (Algorithm 777), and makes extensive use of
                 Fortran 95-derived data types and MPI to support a
                 general linear product (GLP) polynomial system
                 structure. GLP structure is intermediate between the
                 partitioned linear product structure used by
                 POLSYS\_PLP (Algorithm 801) and the BKK-based structure
                 used by PHCPACK. The code requires a GLP structure as
                 input, and although finding the optimal GLP structure
                 is a difficult combinatorial problem, generally
                 physical or engineering intuition about a problem
                 yields a very good GLP structure. POLSYS\_GLP employs a
                 sophisticated power series end game for handling
                 singular solutions, and provides support for problem
                 definition both at a high level and via hand-crafted
                 code. Different GLP structures and their corresponding
                 Bezout numbers can be systematically explored before
                 committing to root finding.",

  abstract =     "In this article we present the implementation of an
                 environment supporting L{\'e}vy's optimal reduction for
                 the {\lambda}-calculus on parallel (or distributed)
                 computing systems. In a similar approach to Lamping's,
                 we base our work on a graph reduction technique, known
                 as directed virtual reduction, which is actually a
                 restriction of Danos-Regnier virtual reduction.\par

                 The environment, which we refer to as PELCR (parallel
                 environment for optimal lambda-calculus reduction),
                 relies on a strategy for directed virtual reduction,
                 namely half combustion. While developing PELCR we
                 adopted both a message aggregation technique, allowing
                 reduction of the communication overhead, and a fair
                 policy for distributing dynamically originated load
                 among processors.\par

                 We also present an experimental study demonstrating the
                 ability of PELCR to definitely exploit the parallelism
                 intrinsic to {\lambda}-terms while performing the
                 reduction. We show how PELCR allows achieving up to
                 70--80\% of the ideal speedup on last generation
                 multiprocessor computing systems. As a last note, the
                 software modules have been developed with the C
                 language and using a standard interface for message
                 passing, that is, MPI, thus making PELCR itself a
                 highly portable software package.",

  abstract =     "Future mainstream microprocessors will likely
                 integrate specialized accelerators, such as GPUs, onto
                 a single die to achieve better performance and power
                 efficiency. However, it remains a keen challenge to
                 program such a heterogeneous multicore platform, since
                 these specialized accelerators feature ISAs and
                 functionality that are significantly different from the
                 general purpose CPU cores. In this paper, we present
                 EXOCHI: (1) Exoskeleton Sequencer (EXO), an
                 architecture to represent heterogeneous accelerators as
                 ISA-based MIMD architecture resources, and a shared
                 virtual memory heterogeneous multithreaded program
                 execution model that tightly couples specialized
                 accelerator cores with general-purpose CPU cores, and
                 (2) C for Heterogeneous Integration (CHI), an
                 integrated C/C++ programming environment that supports
                 accelerator-specific inline assembly and
                 domain-specific languages. The CHI compiler extends the
                 OpenMP pragma for heterogeneous multithreading
                 programming, and produces a single fat binary with code
                 sections corresponding to different instruction sets.
                 The runtime can judiciously spread parallel computation
                 across the heterogeneous cores to optimize performance
                 and power.\par

                 We have prototyped the EXO architecture on a physical
                 heterogeneous platform consisting of an Intel{\reg}
                 Core{\TM} 2 Duo processor and an 8-core 32-thread
                 Intel{\reg} Graphics Media Accelerator X3000. In
                 addition, we have implemented the CHI integrated
                 programming environment with the Intel{\reg} C++
                 Compiler, runtime toolset, and debugger. On the EXO
                 prototype system, we have enhanced a suite of
                 production-quality media kernels for video and image
                 processing to utilize the accelerator through the CHI
                 programming interface, achieving significant speedup
                 (1.41X to10.97X) over execution on the IA32 CPU

  abstract =     "As more processing elements are integrated in a single
                 chip, embedded software design becomes more
                 challenging: It becomes a parallel programming for
                 nontrivial heterogeneous multiprocessors with diverse
                 communication architectures, and design constraints
                 such as hardware cost, power, and timeliness. In the
                 current practice of parallel programming with MPI or
                 OpenMP, the programmer should manually optimize the
                 parallel code for each target architecture and for the
                 design constraints. Thus, the design-space exploration
                 of MPSoC (multiprocessor systems-on-chip) costs become
                 prohibitively large as software development overhead
                 increases drastically. To solve this problem, we
                 develop a parallel-programming framework based on a
                 novel programming model called common intermediate code
                 (CIC). In a CIC, functional parallelism and data
                 parallelism of application tasks are specified
                 independently of the target architecture and design
                 constraints. Then, the CIC translator translates the
                 CIC into the final parallel code, considering the
                 target architecture and design constraints to make the
                 CIC retargetable. Experiments with preliminary
                 examples, including the H.263 decoder, show that the
                 proposed parallel-programming framework increases the
                 design productivity of MPSoC software significantly.",

  abstract =     "Many scientific applications use parallel I/O to meet
                 the low latency and high bandwidth I/O requirement.
                 Among many available parallel I/O operations,
                 collective I/O is one of the most popular methods when
                 the storage layouts and access patterns of data do not
                 match. The implementation of collective I/O typically
                 involves disk I/O operations followed by interprocessor
                 communications. Also, in many I/O-intensive
                 applications, parallel I/O operations are usually
                 followed by parallel computations. This paper presents
                 a comparative study of different overlap strategies in
                 parallel applications. We have experimented with four
                 different overlap strategies 1) Overlapping I/O and
                 communication; 2) Overlapping I/O and computation; 3)
                 Overlapping computation and communication; and 4)
                 Overlapping I/O, communication, and computation. All
                 experiments have been conducted on a Linux Cluster and
                 the performance results obtained are very encouraging.
                 On an average, we have enhanced the performance of a
                 generic collective read call by 38\%, the MxM benchmark
                 by 26\%, and the FFT benchmark by 34\%.",

                 together a variety of high-level distributed computing
                 operations with serial vector
                 operations.\par

                 PyTrilinos is a set of interfaces to existing, compiled
                 libraries. This hybrid framework uses Python as
                 front-end, and efficient precompiled libraries for all
                 computationally expensive tasks. Thus, we take
                 advantage of both the flexibility and ease of use of
                 Python, and the efficiency of the underlying C++, C,
                 and FORTRAN numerical kernels. Out numerical results
                 show that, for many important problem classes, the
                 overhead required by the Python interpreter is
                 negligible.\par

                 To run in parallel, PyTrilinos simply requires a
                 standard Python interpreter. The fundamental MPI calls
                 are encapsulated under an abstract layer that manages
                 all interprocessor communications. This makes serial
                 and parallel scripts using PyTrilinos virtually
                 identical.",

                 computations, including computations involving

                 as the specification for the parallel one. The key idea

                 constrain the search through the parallel program. To
                 handle floating-point operations, three different types

                 algebra algorithms that are coded using the Formal
                 Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME) API. This
                 API expresses algorithms at a higher level of
                 abstraction, avoids the use loop and array indices, and
                 represents these algorithms as they are formally
                 derived and presented. We report on two implementations
                 of the workqueuing model, neither of which requires the
                 use of explicit indices to specify parallelism. The
                 first implementation uses the experimental taskq

                 construct into OpenMP 3.0. The second workqueuing

  abstract =     "Mambo [4] is IBM's full-system simulator which models
                 PowerPC systems, and provides a complete set of
                 simulation tools to help IBM and its partners in
                 pre-hardware development and performance evaluation for
                 future systems. Currently Mambo simulates target
                 systems on a single host thread. When the number of
                 cores increases in a target system, Mambo's simulation
                 performance for each core goes down. As the so-called
                 `multi-core era' approaches, both target and host
                 systems will have more and more cores. It is very
                 important for Mambo to efficiently simulate a
                 multi-core target system on a multi-core host system.
                 Parallelization is a natural method to speed up Mambo
                 under this situation.\par

                 Parallel Mambo (P-Mambo) is a multi-threaded
                 implementation of Mambo. Mambo's simulation engine is
                 implemented as a user-level thread-scheduler. We
                 propose a multi-scheduler method to adapt Mambo's
                 simulation engine to multi-threaded execution. Based on
                 this method a core-based module partition is proposed
                 to achieve both high inter-scheduler parallelism and
                 low inter-scheduler dependency. Protection of shared
                 resources is crucial to both correctness and
                 performance of P-Mambo. Since there are two tiers of
                 threads in P-Mambo, protecting shared resources by only
                 OS-level locks possibly introduces deadlocks due to
                 user-level context switch. We propose a new lock
                 mechanism to handle this problem. Since Mambo is an
                 on-going project with many modules currently under
                 development, co-existence with new modules is also
                 important to P-Mambo. We propose a global-lock-based
                 method to guarantee compatibility of P-Mambo with
                 future Mambo modules.\par

                 We have implemented the first version of P-Mambo in
                 functional modes. The performance of P-Mambo has been
                 evaluated on the OpenMP implementation of NAS Parallel
                 Benchmark (NPB) 3.2 [12]. Preliminary experimental
                 results show that P-Mambo achieves an average speedup
                 of 3.4 on a 4-core host machine.",

                 compactor that is simpler and more efficient than
                 previously reported compactors that comprise two to
                 four phases. Through effective MRE-OS coordination, MC
                 maintains the simplicity of a non-moving collector
                 while providing efficient parallel and concurrent
                 compaction.\par

                 We implement both stop-the-world and concurrent MC in a
                 generational garbage collection framework within the
                 open-source HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. Our
                 experimental evaluation using a multiprocessor
                 indicates that MC significantly increases throughput
                 and scalability as well as reduces pause times,
                 relative to state-of-the-art, parallel and concurrent
                 compactors.",

  abstract =     "The X10 programming language is organized around the
                 notion of places (an encapsulation of data and
                 activities operating on the data), partitioned global
                 address space (PGAS), and asynchronous computation and
                 communication.\par

                 This paper introduces an expressive subset of X10, Flat
                 X10, designed to permit efficient execution across
                 multiple single-threaded places with a simple runtime
                 and without compromising on the productivity of X10. We
                 present the design, implementation and evaluation of a
                 compiler and runtime system for Flat X10. The Flat X10
                 compiler translates programs into C++ SPMD programs
                 communicating using an active messaging infrastructure.
                 It uses novel techniques to transform explicitly
                 parallel programs into SPMD programs. The runtime
                 system is based on IBM's LAPI (Low-level API) and is
                 easily portable to other libraries such as GASNet and
                 ARMCI.\par

                 Our implementation realizes performance comparable to
                 hand-written MPI programs for well-known HPC benchmarks
                 such as Random Access, Stream, and FFT, on a
                 Federation-based cluster of Power5 SMPs (with hundreds

                 processors). Submissions based on the work presented in

                 the need for parallel optimizing compilers to assist
                 developers in creating efficient code. OpenUH is a
                 state-of-the-art optimizing compiler, but it only
                 performs a limited set of optimizations for OpenMP
                 programs due to its conservative assumptions of shared
                 memory programming. These limitations may prevent some
                 OpenMP applications from being fully optimized to the
                 extent of its sequential counterpart. This paper
                 describes our design and implementation of a parallel

  abstract =     "GPGPUs have recently emerged as powerful vehicles for
                 general-purpose high-performance computing. Although a
                 new Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
                 programming model from NVIDIA offers improved
                 programmability for general computing, programming
                 GPGPUs is still complex and error-prone. This paper
                 presents a compiler framework for automatic
                 source-to-source translation of standard OpenMP
                 applications into CUDA-based GPGPU applications. The
                 goal of this translation is to further improve
                 programmability and make existing OpenMP applications
                 amenable to execution on GPGPUs. In this paper, we have
                 identified several key transformation techniques, which
                 enable efficient GPU global memory access, to achieve
                 high performance. Experimental results from two
                 important kernels (JACOBI and SPMUL) and two NAS OpenMP
                 Parallel Benchmarks (EP and CG) show that the described
                 translator and compile-time optimizations work well on
                 both regular and irregular applications, leading to
                 performance improvements of up to 50X over the
                 unoptimized translation (up to 328X over serial).",

                 task can be complex and error-prone even for expert
                 programmers. Before we can allow compilers to handle
                 this complexity for us, we must identify the

                 write applications with reasonable effort, yet specific
                 enough to exploit the vast on-chip memory bandwidth of

  abstract =     "Understanding why the performance of a multithreaded
                 program does not improve linearly with the number of
                 cores in a shared-memory node populated with one or
                 more multicore processors is a problem of growing
                 practical importance. This paper makes three
                 contributions to performance analysis of multithreaded
                 programs. First, we describe how to measure and
                 attribute {\em parallel idleness}, namely, where
                 threads are stalled and unable to work. This technique
                 applies broadly to programming models ranging from
                 explicit threading ({\em e.g.}, Pthreads) to
                 higher-level models such as Cilk and OpenMP. Second, we
                 describe how to measure and attribute {\em parallel
                 overhead\/} -- when a thread is performing
                 miscellaneous work other than executing the user's
                 computation. By employing a combination of compiler
                 support and post-mortem analysis, we incur no
                 measurement cost beyond normal profiling to glean this
                 information. Using {\em idleness\/} and {\em
                 overhead\/} metrics enables one to pinpoint areas of an
                 application where concurrency should be increased (to
                 reduce idleness), decreased (to reduce overhead), or
                 where the present parallelization is hopeless (where
                 idleness and overhead are both high). Third, we
                 describe how to measure and attribute arbitrary
                 performance metrics for high-level multithreaded
                 programming models, such as Cilk. This requires
                 bridging the gap between the expression of logical
                 concurrency in programs and its realization at run-time
                 as it is adaptively partitioned and scheduled onto a
                 pool of threads. We have prototyped these ideas in the
                 context of Rice University's HPCToolkit performance
                 tools. We describe our approach, implementation, and
                 experiences applying this approach to measure and
                 attribute work, idleness, and overhead in executions of
                 Cilk programs.",

  abstract =     "Compiler-based auto-parallelization is a much studied
                 area, yet has still not found wide-spread application.
                 This is largely due to the poor exploitation of
                 application parallelism, subsequently resulting in
                 performance levels far below those which a skilled
                 expert programmer could achieve. We have identified two
                 weaknesses in traditional parallelizing compilers and
                 propose a novel, integrated approach, resulting in
                 significant performance improvements of the generated
                 parallel code. Using profile-driven parallelism
                 detection we overcome the limitations of static
                 analysis, enabling us to identify more application
                 parallelism and only rely on the user for final
                 approval. In addition, we replace the traditional
                 target-specific and inflexible mapping heuristics with
                 a machine-learning based prediction mechanism,
                 resulting in better mapping decisions while providing
                 more scope for adaptation to different target
                 architectures. We have evaluated our parallelization
                 strategy against the NAS and SPEC OMP benchmarks and
                 two different multi-core platforms (dual quad-core
                 Intel Xeon SMP and dual-socket QS20 Cell blade). We
                 demonstrate that our approach not only yields
                 significant improvements when compared with
                 state-of-the-art parallelizing compilers, but comes
                 close to and sometimes exceeds the performance of
                 manually parallelized codes. On average, our
                 methodology achieves 96\% of the performance of the
                 hand-tuned OpenMP NAS and SPEC parallel benchmarks on
                 the Intel Xeon platform and gains a significant speedup
                 for the IBM Cell platform, demonstrating the potential

                 interleavings with the help of a verification

                 interleavings is exponential, and impractical to

                 and automatic compiler-based approach to mapping such
                 parallelism using machine learning. It develops two
                 predictors: a data sensitive and a data insensitive
                 predictor to select the best mapping for parallel
                 programs. They predict the number of threads and the
                 scheduling policy for any given program using a model
                 learnt off-line. By using low-cost profiling runs, they
                 predict the mapping for a new unseen program across
                 multiple input data sets. We evaluate our approach by
                 selecting parallelism mapping configurations for OpenMP
                 programs on two representative but different multi-core
                 platforms (the Intel Xeon and the Cell processors).
                 Performance of our technique is stable across programs
                 and architectures. On average, it delivers above 96\%
                 performance of the maximum available on both platforms.
                 It achieve, on average, a 37\% (up to 17.5 {\em
                 times\/}) performance improvement over the OpenMP
                 runtime default scheme on the Cell platform. Compared
                 to two recent prediction models, our predictors achieve
                 better performance with a significant lower profiling
                 cost.",

  abstract =     "Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a widely used
                 standard for managing coarse-grained concurrency on
                 distributed computers. Debugging parallel MPI
                 applications, however, has always been a particularly
                 challenging task due to their high degree of concurrent
                 execution and non-deterministic behavior. Deterministic
                 replay is a potentially powerful technique for
                 addressing these challenges, with existing MPI replay
                 tools adopting either data-replay or order-replay
                 approaches. Unfortunately, each approach has its
                 tradeoffs. Data-replay generates substantial log sizes
                 by recording every communication message. Order-replay
                 generates small logs, but requires all processes to be
                 replayed together. We believe that these drawbacks are
                 the primary reasons that inhibit the wide adoption of
                 deterministic replay as the critical enabler of cyclic
                 debugging of MPI applications.\par

                 This paper describes {\em subgroup reproducible
                 replay\/} (SRR), a hybrid deterministic replay method
                 that provides the benefits of both data-replay and
                 order-replay while balancing their trade-offs. SRR
                 divides all processes into disjoint groups. It records
                 the contents of messages crossing group boundaries as
                 in data-replay, but records just message orderings for
                 communication within a group as in order-replay. In
                 this way, SRR can exploit the communication locality of
                 traffic patterns in MPI applications. During replay,
                 developers can then replay each group individually. SRR
                 reduces recording overhead by not recording intra-group
                 communication, and reduces replay overhead by limiting
                 the size of each replay group. Exposing these tradeoffs
                 gives the user the necessary control for making
                 deterministic replay practical for MPI
                 applications.\par

                 We have implemented a prototype, MPIWiz, to demonstrate
                 and evaluate SRR. MPIWiz employs a replay framework
                 that allows transparent binary instrumentation of both
                 library and system calls. As a result, MPIWiz replays
                 MPI applications with no source code modification and
                 relinking, and handles non-determinism in both MPI and
                 OS system calls. Our preliminary results show that
                 MPIWiz can reduce recording overhead by over a factor
                 of four relative to data-replay, yet without requiring
                 the entire application to be replayed as in
                 order-replay. Recording increases execution time by
                 27\% while the application can be replayed in just 53\%
                 of its base execution time.",

                 Sequential Processes (CSP) are used to realize a

  abstract =     "The models of computations that express concurrency
                 naturally are preferred for initial specification of
                 MPSoC system, since popular programming languages such
                 as C and C++ are designed for sequential execution. In
                 our previous work, we proposed a design framework where
                 two models are used for the initial specification of
                 the system behavior; task model at the top level and
                 dataflow model inside each task. After the partition
                 and mapping process is performed with each architecture
                 candidate, the target code is automatically generated
                 for both Design-Space Exploration (DSE) and final
                 implementation. In this article, we focus on parallel
                 code generation for MPSoC, proposing two main
                 techniques. The first is to express functional and data
                 parallelism differently following the partition and
                 mapping decision. In the proposed technique, the
                 generated code consists of multiple tasks running
                 concurrently, which achieves functional parallelism. On
                 the other hand, we use OpenMP directives to express
                 data parallelism inside a task. Second is to adopt the
                 code serialization technique to execute a multitasking
                 application without OS scheduler, aiming to generate
                 the highly portable code on various platforms for an
                 efficient DSE process. We extend the previous code
                 serialization techniques to multiprocessor systems and
                 utilize the formal properties of the dataflow model for
                 efficient code generation. The experiments including
                 H.263 codec example show the viability of the proposed
                 technique and the efficiency of the generated code.",

  abstract =     "Communication overhead is one of the dominant factors
                 affecting performance in high-performance computing
                 systems. To reduce the negative impact of
                 communication, programmers overlap communication and
                 computation by using asynchronous communication
                 primitives. This increases code complexity, requiring
                 more development effort and making less readable
                 programs. This paper presents the hybrid use of MPI and
                 SMPSs (SMP superscalar, a task-based shared-memory
                 programming model) that allows the programmer to easily
                 introduce the asynchrony necessary to overlap
                 communication and computation. We demonstrate the
                 hybrid use of MPI/SMPSs with the high-performance
                 LINPACK benchmark (HPL), and compare it to the pure MPI
                 implementation, which uses the look-ahead technique to
                 overlap communication and computation. The hybrid
                 MPI/SMPSs version significantly improves the
                 performance of the pure MPI version, getting close to
                 the asymptotic performance at medium problem sizes and
                 still getting significant benefits at small/large

                 perform poorly when those libraries interfere with one

                 leading to destructive resource oversubscription. This
                 paper presents the design and implementation of {\em

                 primitives and a standard interface for composing
                 parallel codes efficiently. Lithe can be inserted

                 provide {\em bolt-on\/} composability without needing
                 to change existing application code. Lithe can also
                 serve as the foundation for building new parallel

  abstract =     "We present Lazy Binary Splitting (LBS), a user-level
                 scheduler of nested parallelism for shared-memory
                 multiprocessors that builds on existing Eager Binary
                 Splitting work-stealing (EBS) implemented in Intel's
                 Threading Building Blocks (TBB), but improves
                 performance and ease-of-programming. In its simplest
                 form (SP), EBS requires manual tuning by repeatedly
                 running the application under carefully controlled
                 conditions to determine a {\em stop-splitting-threshold
                 (sst)\/} for every do-all loop in the code. This
                 threshold limits the parallelism and prevents excessive
                 overheads for fine-grain parallelism. Besides being
                 tedious, this tuning also over-fits the code to some
                 particular dataset, platform and calling context of the
                 do-all loop, resulting in poor performance portability
                 for the code. LBS overcomes both the performance
                 portability and ease-of-programming pitfalls of a
                 manually fixed threshold by adapting dynamically to
                 run-time conditions without requiring tuning.\par

                 We compare LBS to Auto-Partitioner (AP), the latest
                 default scheduler of TBB, which does not require manual
                 tuning either but lacks context portability, and
                 outperform it by 38.9\% using TBB's default AP
                 configuration, and by 16.2\% after we tuned AP to our
                 experimental platform. We also compare LBS to SP by
                 manually finding SP's sst using a training dataset and
                 then running both on a different execution dataset. LBS
                 outperforms SP by 19.5\% on average. while allowing for
                 improved performance portability without requiring
                 tedious manual tuning. LBS also outperforms SP with
                 {\em sst=1}, its default value when undefined, by
                 56.7\%, and serializing work-stealing (SWS), another
                 work-stealer by 54.7\%. Finally, compared to
                 serializing inner parallelism (SI) which has been used
                 by OpenMP, LBS is 54.2\% faster.",

                 synchronization overheads. We find that these can
                 amount to 47\% of TBB benchmark runtime and 80\% of
                 OpenMP benchmark runtime. Second, we propose load

                 criticality-guided task stealing, to boost performance.

  abstract =     "Many recent parallelization tools lower the barrier
                 for parallelizing a program, but overlook one of the
                 first questions that a programmer needs to answer:
                 which parts of the program should I spend time
                 parallelizing?\par

                 This paper examines Kremlin, an automatic tool that,
                 given a serial version of a program, will make
                 recommendations to the user as to what regions (e.g.
                 loops or functions) of the program to attack first.
                 Kremlin introduces a novel hierarchical critical path
                 analysis and develops a new metric for estimating the
                 potential of parallelizing a region: self-parallelism.
                 We further introduce the concept of a parallelism
                 planner, which provides a ranked order of specific
                 regions to the programmer that are likely to have the
                 largest performance impact when parallelized. Kremlin
                 supports multiple planner personalities, which allow
                 the planner to more effectively target a particular
                 programming environment or class of machine.\par

                 We demonstrate the effectiveness of one such
                 personality, an OpenMP planner, by comparing versions
                 of programs that are parallelized according to
                 Kremlin's plan against third-party manually
                 parallelized versions. The results show that Kremlin's
                 OpenMP planner is highly effective, producing plans
                 whose performance is typically comparable to, and
                 sometimes much better than, manual parallelization. At
                 the same time, these plans would require that the user
                 parallelize significantly fewer regions of the
                 program.",
