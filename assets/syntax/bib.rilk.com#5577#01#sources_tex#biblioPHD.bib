  abstract = {Model calibration is fundamental in applications of deterministic
       process-based models. Uncertainty in model predictions depends
       much on the input data and observations available for model
       calibration. Here we explored how model predictions (forecasts)
       and their uncertainties vary with the length of time series
       data used in calibration. As an example we used the
       hydrogeochemical model MAGIC and data from Birkenes, a small
       catchment in southern Norway, to simulate future water
       chemistry under a scenario of reduced acid deposition. A
       Bayesian approach with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
       technique was used to calibrate the model to different lengths
       of observed data (4-29 years) and to estimate the prediction
       uncertainty each calibration. The results show that the
       difference between modelled and observed water chemistry
       (calibration goodness of fit) in general decreases with
       increasing length of the time series used in calibration.
       However, there are considerable differences for different time
       series of the same length. The results also show that the
       uncertainties in predicted future acid neutralizing capacity
       were lowest (i.e. the distribution peak narrowest) when using
       the longest time series for calibration. As for calibration
       success, there were considerable differences between the future
       distributions (prediction uncertainty) for the different
       calibrations.},

       Bayesian approach is used to combine data from observations,

       obtain forecast distributions. A case study is presented in
       which the statistical framework is applied using the

       from acidification of soils and surface waters at a long-term

       conditions. The water quality parameters are coupled with a
       simple doseresponse model for trout population health.
       Uncertainties in model output parameters are estimated and
       forecast results are presented as probability distributions for
       future water chemistry and as probability distributions of
       future healthy trout populations. The forecast results are
       examined for three different scenarios of future acid
       deposition corresponding to three different emissions control
       strategies for Europe. Despite the explicit consideration of
       uncertainties propagated into the future forecasts, there are
       clear differences among the scenarios. The case study
       illustrates how inclusion of uncertainties in model predictions
       can strengthen the inferences drawn from model results in

       version of the Schwarz criterion, corrected for small samples

  abstract = {The traditional life cycle assessment (LCA) does not perform
       quantitative uncertainty analysis. However, without
       characterizing the associated uncertainty, the reliability of
       assessment results cannot be understood or ascertained. In this
       study, the Bayesian method, in combination with the Monte Carlo
       technique, is used to quantify and update the uncertainty in
       LCA results. A case study of applying the method to comparison
       of alternative waste treatment options in terms of global
       warming potential due to greenhouse gas emissions is presented.
       In the case study, the prior distributions of the parameters
       used for estimating emission inventory and environmental impact
       in LCA were based on the expert judgment from the
       intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) guideline and
       were subsequently updated using the likelihood distributions
       resulting from both national statistic and site-specific data.
       The posterior uncertainty distribution of the LCA results was
       generated using Monte Carlo simulations with posterior
       parameter probability distributions. The results indicated that
       the incorporation of quantitative uncertainty analysis into LCA
       revealed more information than the deterministic LCA method,
       and the resulting decision may thus be different. In addition,
       in combination with the Monte Carlo simulation, calculations of
       correlation coefficients facilitated the identification of
       important parameters that had major influence to LCA results.
       Finally, by using national statistic data and site-specific
       information to update the prior uncertainty distribution, the
       resultant uncertainty associated with the LCA results could be
       reduced. A better informed decision can therefore be made based
       on the clearer and more complete comparison of options. (c)

  abstract = {This study investigates a probabilistic approach for the inverse
       problem associated with blending time-dependent ecosystem
       models and observations. The goal is to combine prior
       information, in the form of ecological dynamics and substantive
       knowledge about uncertain parameters, with available
       measurements. Posterior estimates of both the time-varying
       ecological state variables and the model parameters are
       obtained, along with their uncertainty. Ecological models of
       interacting populations are considered in the context of a
       nonlinear, non-Gaussian state space model. This comprises a
       nonlinear stochastic difference equation for the ecological
       dynamics, and an observation equation which relates the model
       state to the measurements. Complex error processes are readily
       incorporated. The posterior probability density function
       provides a complete solution to the inverse problem. Bayes'
       theorem allows one to obtain this posterior density through
       synthesis of the prior information and the observations. To
       illustrate this Bayesian inverse method, these ideas are
       applied to a simple ecosystem box model concerned with
       predicting the seasonal co-evolution of a population of grazing
       shellfish and its two food sources: plankton and detritus.
       Observations of shellfish biomass over time are available.
       Lognormal system noise was incorporated into the ecosystem
       equations at all time steps. Ingestion and respiration
       parameters for shellfish growth are considered as uncertain
       quantities described by beta distributions. Stochastic
       simulation was carried out and provided predictions of the
       model state with uncertainty estimates. The Bayesian inverse
       method was then used to assimilate the additional information
       contained in the observations. Posterior probability density
       functions for the parameters and time-varying ecological state
       were computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The
       ecological dynamics spread the measurement information to all
       state variables and parameters, even those not directly
       observed. Probabilistic state estimates are refined in
       comparison to those from the stochastic simulation. It is
       concluded that this Bayesian approach appears promising as a
       framework for ecosystem inverse problems, but requires careful
       control of the dimensionality for practical applications. (C)

       step and thus provide useful information for optimizing
       agricultural techniques. But the prediction errors of these
       models are often large due to uncertainties in parameters,
       initial state values, and equations. Monte Carlo sequential
       methods, like the interacting particle filter [Del Moral, 1996.
       Nonlinear filtering: interacting particle solution. Markov
       Process. Relat. Fields 2, 555-580], can be used to update the
       state variable values predicted by nonlinear dynamic models
       from a set of measurements and thus reduce the prediction
       errors. An interesting feature of these methods is that they do
       not require a linearization of the original nonlinear model. Up
       to now, these methods have never been applied to complex
       dynamic crop models. In this paper, the interacting particle
       filter was used to update the Azodyn model, a dynamic winter
       wheat crop model, at 10 or 11 dates, from biomass and nitrogen
       uptake measurements, and to predict a variable of practical
       interest, the nitrogen nutrition index. We showed that the
       implementation of this method can reduce the root mean squared
       error by 66.7-79.7\% for the nitrogen nutrition index, but that
       the filter is highly sensitive to the assumptions made about
       the probability distribution of the model errors. We also
       showed that the particle filter gives stable results with
       10,000 Monte Carlo simulations and that this number of

  abstract = {Ecosystem models help us understand the mechanisms that influence
       ecosystem health indicators. However, if they are too complex,
       these mechanisms can be difficult to identify. On the other
       hand, if they are too simple the mechanisms may be distorted or
       even absent. Determining an appropriate level of model
       complexity is therefore desirable. This paper introduces two
       model simplification methods that are based on the sensitivity
       of performance measures to model rates and components. The
       first method identifies rates that have little influence on the
       performance measures and subsequently eliminates them. The
       second identifies, for a given performance measure, state
       variables that can be made constant. The methods can be
       implemented automatically, so that familiarity with the model
       is not required a priori. Demonstrating with a biogeochemical
       model of Port Phillip Bay, Australia, we find that significant
       reduction in model complexity is possible, including reductions
       in model order. Also, the process of implementing the methods

       is carried out via Bayesian melding, in which information from
       prior knowledge and a deterministic computer model is
       conditioned on a likelihood function. We used predictions from
       an empirical forest growth model G-HAT in place of field
       observations of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in
       a deciduous temperate forest ecosystem. Using Bayesian melding,
       priors for the inputs of the process-based forest ecosystem
       PnET-II were propagated through the model, and likelihoods for

       northern Wisconsin was analyzed for the years 1997-2004. During
       this time, the WLEF region was a source of CO2 to the
       atmosphere averaging 120 g C m(-2) year(-1), with a range of
       interannual variability of 140 g C m(-2) year(-1). Random
       uncertainty in annual sums of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) due
       to turbulent variability and gap-filling was estimated to be
       15-20 g C m(-2) year(-1). Although magnitudes of NEE sums were
       affected systematically by the choice of friction velocity (u*)
       threshold, this choice had little effect on interannual
       variability of annual sums. The WLEF region was, on average, a
       source of carbon from 1997 to 2004 regardless of the u*
       threshold applied. Interannually, daytime NEE sums varied more
       than nighttime NEE sums, and spring and summer NEE sums varied
       more than autumn and winter NEE sums. Interannual variations in
       seasonal sums of daytime, nighttime and total NEE were often
       strongly correlated with changes in soil moisture and soil
       temperature. Standard nonlinear gap-filling regression models
       of respiration and gross ecosystem productivity were extended
       to incorporate the effects of soil moisture and phenology and
       combined into a single model of NEE. The Markov Chain Monte
       Carlo (MCMC) data assimilation technique was performed using
       observed WLEF NEE to derive full probability density functions

       little effect on posterior parameter PDFs, but significant
       differences in parameter PDFs occurred depending on whether
       daytime NEE, nighttime NEE, or total NEE data were used. This
       simple model was moderately successful in producing
       statistically significant correlations with interannual
       variations in annual and growing season NEE sums, but was
       generally unsuccessful in spring and autumn. In all cases, the

  abstract = {Bayesian Maximum Entropy was used to estimate the probabilities of
       occurrence of soil categories in the Netherlands, and to
       simulate realizations from the associated multi-point pdf.
       Besides the hard observations (H) of the categories at 8369
       locations, the soil map of the Netherlands 1:50 000 was used as
       soft information (S). The category with the maximum estimated
       probability was used as the predicted category. The quality of
       the resulting BME(HS)-map was compared with that of the
       BME(H)-map obtained by using only the hard data in BME-
       estimation, and with the existing soil map. Validation with a
       probability sample showed that the use of the soft information
       in BME-estimation leads to a considerable and significant
       increase of map purity by 15\%. This increase of map purity was
       due to the high purity of the existing soil map (71.3\%). The
       purity of the BME(HS) was only slightly larger than that of the
       existing soil map. This was due to the small correlation length
       of the soil categories. The theoretical purity of the BME-maps
       overestimated the actual map purity, which can be partly
       explained by the biased estimates of the one-point bivariate
       probabilities of hard and soft categories of the same label.
       Part of the hard data is collected to describe characteristic
       soil profiles of the map units which explains the bias.
       Therefore, care must be taken when using the purposively
       selected data in soil information systems for calibrating the
       probability model. It is concluded that BME is a valuable
       method for spatial prediction and simulation of soil categories
       when the number of categories is rather small (say < 10). For
       larger numbers of categories, the computational burden becomes
       prohibitive, and large samples are needed for calibration of
       the probability model.},

  abstract = {Although environmental processes at large scales are to a great degree
       the resultant of processes at smaller scales, models
       representing these processes can vary considerably from scale
       to scale. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly,
       different processes dominate at different scales, and so
       different processes are ignored in the simplification step of
       the model development. Secondly, input data are often absent or
       of a much lower quality at larger scales, which results in a
       tendency to use simpler, empirical models at the larger scale.
       Third, the support of the inputs and outputs of a model changes
       with change of scale, and this affects the relationships
       between them. Given these reasons for using different models at
       different scales, application of a model developed at a
       specific scale to a larger scale should be treated with care.
       Instead, models should be modified to suit the larger scale,
       and for this purpose uncertainty analyses can be extremely
       helpful. If upscaling disturbed the balance between the
       contributions of input and model error to the output error,
       then an uncertainty analysis will show this. Uncertainty
       analysis will also show how to restore the balance. In
       practice, application of uncertainty analysis is severely
       hampered by difficulties in the assessment of input and model
       error. Knowledge of the short distance spatial variability is
       of paramount importance to input error assessment with a change
       of support, but current geographical databases rarely convey
       this type of information. Model error can only be estimated
       reliably by validation, but this is not easy because the
       support of model predictions and validation measurements is
       usually not the same.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods are experiencing increased use for probabilistic
       ecological modelling. Most Bayesian inference requires the
       numerical approximation of analytically intractable integrals.
       Two methods based on Monte Carlo simulation have appeared in
       the ecological/environmental modelling literature, Though they
       sound similar, the Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) and Markov Chain
       Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are very different in their
       efficiency and effectiveness in providing useful approximations
       for accurate inference in Bayesian applications. We compare
       these two methods using a low-dimensional biochemical oxygen
       demand decay model as an example. We demonstrate that the BMC
       is extremely inefficient because the prior parameter
       distribution, from which the Monte Carlo sample is drawn, is
       often a poor surrogate for the posterior parameter
       distribution, particularly if the parameters are highly
       correlated. In contrast, MCMC generates a chain that converges,
       in distribution, on the posterior parameter distribution, that
       can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution.
       The inefficiency of the BMC can lead to marginal posterior
       parameter distributions that appear irregular and may be highly
       misleading because the important region of the posterior
       distribution may never be sampled. We also point out that a
       priori specification of the model error variance can strongly
       influence the estimation of the principal model parameters.
       Although the BMC does not require that the model error variance
       be specified, most published applications have treated this
       variance as a known constant. Finally, we note that most
       published BMC applications have chosen a uniform prior
       distribution, making the BMC more similar to a likelihood-based
       inference rather than a Bayesian method because the posterior
       is unaffected by the prior. Though other prior distributions
       could be applied, the treatment of Monte Carlo samples with any
       other choice of prior distribution has not been discussed in
       the BMC literature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

       modelling: how to update information (if any) on parameter
       uncertainty by using the information on the actual system. In
       the probabilistic (Bayesian) context this implies estimating
       the posterior probability distribution of the parameters on the
       basis of prior information and the probability distribution of
       measurements. In other contexts the procedure may result in a
       set or a possibility distribution (fuzzy representation) in
       parameter space. Although the solution to the inverse problem
       is apparently straightforward, to be practical it requires
       either fairly restrictive assumptions or it makes large
       computational demands. The paper presents an algorithm to solve
       the inverse problem in various contexts which is generally
       applicable and computationally efficient. The method is
       illustrated on various test functions and an actual case study.
       For calibration problems with a moderate number of dimensions
       (or: higher-dimensional problems that can be reduced to these)
       the new algorithm provides a robust and relatively efficient
       way to characterize posterior parameter distributions or sets.
       The algorithm requires a number of function evaluations
       proportional to the logarithm of the search volume, while for
       conventional random search this number increases proportional
       to search volume itself. For inherently high dimensional
       problems the present approach is still relatively efficient,
       but slow in absolute numbers of function evaluations.},

       Binley. The second, known as the Metropolis algorithm, differs
       from importance sampling in that it uses a random walk that
       adapts to the true probability distribution describing
       parameter uncertainty. Three case studies are used to
       investigate and illustrate these Monte Carlo approaches. The
       first considers a simple water balance model for which exact

       seriously misleading results. The second and third case studies

       concentration of chlorophyll in the worlds oceans. These
       observations can be used to improve our understanding of the
       oceanic ecosystem if the appropriate data assimilation
       techniques are available to combine them with an ecosystem
       model. In this paper we explore a novel method, based on Bayes
       Theorem and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm, of estimating
       a subset of the parameters in a seven compartment ecosystem
       model. The model describes the flows of nitrogen amongst
       phytoplankton, zooplankton, nitrate, bacteria, ammonium,
       dissolved organic nitrogen and detritus. We first generate
       synthetic observations from the model and then, in three
       separate experiments, try to recover subsets of the model
       parameters from clean and noisy versions of these. Bayes
       Theorem allows us to combine both prior information on the
       parameter values and the observations to generate a posterior
       probability density function of the parameters. The Metropolis-
       Hastings algorithm then allows us to produce Markov chains that
       sample this posterior probability density function and recover
       the parameter means, variances and standard errors. We find
       that the technique is very successful in recovering information
       on a small number of parameters but that the time required to
       solve the model makes it impractical to find second order
       properties of more than about ten of the model parameters. (C)

  abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems have the potential to sequester carbon in
       soils by altering agricultural management practices (i.e.
       tillage practice, cover crops, and crop rotation) and using
       agricultural inputs (i.e. fertilizers and irrigation) more
       efficiently. Changes in agricultural practices can also cause
       changes in CO2 emissions associated with these practices. In
       order to account for changes in net CO2 emissions, and thereby
       estimate the overall impact of carbon sequestration initiatives
       on the atmospheric CO2 pool, we use a methodology for full
       carbon cycle analysis of agricultural ecosystems. The analysis
       accounts for changes in carbon sequestration and emission rates
       with time, and results in values representing a change in net
       carbon flux. Comparison among values of net carbon flux for two
       or more systems, using the initial system as a baseline value,
       results in a value for relative net carbon flux. Some results
       from using the full carbon cycle methodology, along with US
       national average values for agricultural inputs, indicate that
       the net carbon flux averaged over all crops following
       conversion from conventional tillage to no-till is -189 kg C
       ha(-1) year(-1) (a negative value indicates net transfer of
       carbon from the atmosphere). The relative net carbon flux,
       using conventional tillage as the baseline, is -371 kg C ha(-1)
       year(-1), which represents the total atmospheric CO2 reduction
       caused by changing tillage practices. The methodology used here
       illustrates the importance of (1) delineating system
       boundaries, (2) including CO2 emissions associated with
       sequestration initiatives in the accounting process, and (3)
       comparing the new management practices associated with
       sequestration initiatives with the original management
       practices to obtain the true impact of sequestration projects
       on the atmospheric CO2 pool. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {The process-based models DNDC and PnET-N-DNDC were evaluated with
       regard to their potential to calculate regional inventories of
       N-trace gas emissions from agricultural and forest soils. To
       extend the model predictions to regional scale, we linked the
       models to a detailed GIS-database for Saxony, Germany, which
       was holding all the spatially and temporally differentiated
       input information and other model drivers. Total annual N2O-
       emissions from agricultural soils in Saxony ranged from
       0.5-26.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) and were calculated to amount
       to approx. 5475 t N2O-N yr(-1) in the year 1995, which compares
       quite well with previous estimates based on the IPCC approach
       (4892 t N2O-N yr(-1)). Compared to the agricultural soils, N2O-
       emissions from forest soils in Saxony (range: 0.04-19.7 kg
       N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were much lower and amounted to 1011 t
       N2O-N yr(-1). In comparison with other sources of N2O in Saxony
       our estimates show, that - even in such a highly industrialised
       region like Saxony - soils contribute more than 50\% to the
       total regional N2O source strength. Simulated emissions of NO
       from the agricultural and forest soils were approx. in the same
       magnitude than for N2O. The modelled NO-emission rates ranged
       from 0.4-26.3 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the agricultural soils
       and 0.04-28.3 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the forest soils with
       total emissions of 8868 t NO-N yr(-1) (agricultural soils) and
       4155 t NO-N yr(-1) (forest soils). Our results indicated that
       the agricultural and forest soils were a significant source,
       which contributed 17.9\% of the total NOx emissions from various
       sources in Saxony. Furthermore, a series of sensitivity tests
       were carried out, which demonstrated that variations in soil
       organic carbon content (SOC) and soil texture significantly
       effect the modelled N-trace gas emissions from agricultural
       soils at the regional scale, whereas, in addition, for forest
       soils also the soil pH is within the sensitive factors.
       Finally, multi-year simulations were conducted for the region
       with observed meteorological data from 1994-1996. The results
       demonstrated that the modelled interannual variations, which
       were obviously induced by only the climate conditions, in the
       N-gas emissions were as high as 36\%. The high interannual
       variations imply that multi-year (e.g., 5-10 years), instead of
       single baseline year, simulations would produce more reliable
       estimates of mean soil N2O-emissions at regional scale. With
       respect to the Kyoto protocol this means that the mean N2O-
       emissions from soils in the period 1988-1992 should be
       evaluated instead of focusing on a single year, 1990.},

  abstract = {[ 1] Arable soils are a large source of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions,
       making up half of the biogenic emissions worldwide. Estimating
       their source strength requires methods capable of capturing the
       spatial and temporal variability of N2O emissions, along with
       the effects of crop management. Here we applied a process-based
       model, Crop Environmental REsources Synthesis (CERES), with
       geo-referenced input data on soils, weather, and land use to
       map N2O emissions from wheat-cropped soils in three
       agriculturally intensive regions in France. Emissions were
       mostly controlled by soil type and local climate conditions,
       and only to a minor extent by the doses of fertilizer nitrogen
       applied. As a result, the direct emission factors calculated at
       the regional level were much smaller ( ranging from 0.0007 to
       0.0033 kg N2O-N kg(-1) N) than the value of 0.0125 kg N2O-N
       kg(-1) N currently recommended in the IPCC Tier 1 methodology.
       Regional emissions were far more sensitive to the soil
       microbial characteristics governing denitrification and its
       fraction evolved as N2O, soil bulk density, and soil initial
       inorganic N content. Mitigation measures should therefore
       target a reduction in the amount of soil inorganic N upon
       sowing of winter crops, and a decrease of the soil N2O
       production potential itself. From a general perspective, taking
       into account the spatial variability of soils and climate
       thereby appears necessary to improve the accuracy of national
       inventories, and to tailor mitigation strategies to regional
       characteristics.},

  abstract = {Historically, soils have lost 40-90 Pg carbon (C) globally through
       cultivation and disturbance with current rates of C loss due to
       land use change of about 1.6 +/- 0.8 Pg C y(-1), mainly in the
       tropics. Since soils contain more than twice the C found in the
       atmosphere, loss of C from soils can have a significant effect
       of atmospheric CO2 concentration, and thereby on climate.
       Halting land-use conversion would be an effective mechanism to
       reduce soil C losses, but with a growing population and
       changing dietary preferences in the developing world, more land
       is likely to be required for agriculture. Maximizing the
       productivity of existing agricultural land and applying best
       management practices to that land would slow the loss of, or is
       some cases restore, soil C. There are, however, many barriers
       to implementing best management practices, the most significant
       of which in developing countries are driven by poverty.
       Management practices that also improve food security and
       profitability are most likely to be adopted. Soil C management
       needs to considered within a broader framework of sustainable
       development. Policies to encourage fair trade, reduced
       subsidies for agriculture in developed countries and less
       onerous interest on loans and foreign debt would encourage
       sustainable development, which in turn would encourage the

  abstract = {Future climate warming is expected to enhance plant growth in temperate ecosystems and to increase carbon sequestration(1,2). But although severe regional heatwaves may become more frequent in a changing climate(3,4), their impact on terrestrial carbon cycling is unclear. Here we report measurements of ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes, remotely sensed radiation absorbed by plants, and country- level crop yields taken during the European heatwave in 2003. We use a terrestrial biosphere simulation model(5) to assess continental- scale changes in primary productivity during 2003, and their consequences for the net carbon balance. We estimate a 30 per cent reduction in gross primary productivity over Europe, which resulted in a strong anomalous net source of carbon dioxide ( 0.5 Pg Cyr(-1)) to the atmosphere and reversed the effect of four years of net ecosystem carbon sequestration(6). Our results suggest that productivity reduction in eastern and western Europe can be explained by rainfall deficit and extreme summer heat, respectively. We also find that ecosystem respiration decreased together with gross primary productivity, rather than accelerating with the temperature rise. Model results, corroborated by historical records of crop yields, suggest that such a reduction in Europe's primary productivity is unprecedented during the last century. An increase in future drought events could turn temperate ecosystems into carbon sources, contributing to positive carbon- climate feedbacks already anticipated in the tropics and at high latitudes(1,2).},

       their specific effect has yet to be studied. We have analysed
       different functions describing the effects of soil moisture,

       set of soil temperature (T) and water potential (Psi) obtained
       in the held in Northern France. Comparison between f(T) and
       g(psi) was realised using a common values of 'reference'
       temperature and moisture (T-ref and Psi(ref)), values at which
       f(T), and g(psi) are equal to 1 in all models. Large
       differences were observed among proposed f(T) especially when
       T-ref = 35 degrees C, which is much higher than the average
       temperature of data set examined (T = 11 degrees C). In this

       boundary line approach was used to apply results from

       measurements on field scale in southern Germany. Boundary lines
       were fitted to the rim of the data points in scattergrams
       depicting readily obtainable soil variables against the

       hypothesis that this line depicts the functional dependency
       between the two variables. For determining these boundary lines
       a novel method was applied. The function best representing the
       relationship between the N2O flux and soil temperature had a
       maximum above 23 degrees C and the one between the N2O flux and
       the water filled pore space (WFPS, to represent water content)

  abstract = {Agricultural soils are a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O).
       Since mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is needed in all
       sectors of society, it is important to identify the processes
       producing N2O and the factors affecting the production rates in
       agricultural soils. This study aimed to elucidate the N2O
       production in peat, clay and loamy sand at four different soil
       moisture conditions (40, 60, 80 and 100\% Water Filled Pore
       Space). The acetylene inhibition technique was used to evaluate
       the contribution of nitrification to N2O production. Nitrous
       oxide production responded markedly to soil moisture in all
       three soils. The highest N2O production, measured at the
       wettest soils (100\% WFPS), was up to four orders of magnitude
       higher than that at the dry soils (40\% WFPS). In dry conditions
       N2O production decreased in the order of peat>clay>loamy sand,
       while in wet conditions the highest N2O production was measured
       in loamy sand, then in peat, and the lowest in clay soils.
       Nitrification was the dominant N2O producing process in all the
       soils at 60\% WFPS. In the sandy soil 70\% of the total N2O
       production originated from nitrification, while in the peat
       soil most of the total N2O production originated from
       denitrification. Data on processes producing N2O in
       agricultural soils are needed to develop process-based models
       that could reduce the uncertainty of the emission estimates in

       productive grass-clover dairy pastures to assess the influences
       of soil moisture, temperature, availability of N (NH4+ and
       NO3-) and soluble C on N2O emissions, and to use the emission
       data to validate and refine a simulation model (DNDC). The
       soils at these pasture sites (Karapoti fine sandy loam, and
       Tokomaru silt loam) differed in texture and drainage
       characteristics. Emission peaks for N2O coincided with rainfall
       events and high soil moisture content. Large inherent
       variations in N2O fluxes were observed throughout the year in
       both the ungrazed (control) and grazed pastures. Fluxes
       averaged 4.3 and 5.0 g N2O/ha/day for the two ungrazed sites.
       The N2O fluxes from the grazed sites were much higher than for
       the ungrazed sites, averaging 26.4 g N2O/ ha/day for the fine
       sandy loam soil, and 32.0 g N2O/ ha/day for the silt loam soil.
       Our results showed that excretal and fertiliser-N input, and
       water-filled pore space (WFPS) were the variables that most
       strongly regulated N2O fluxes. The DNDC model was modified to
       include the effects of day length on pasture growth, and of
       excretal-N inputs from grazing animals; the value of the WFPS
       threshold was also modified. The modified model 'NZ-DNDC'
       simulated effectively most of the WFPS and N2O emission pulses
       and trends from both the ungrazed and grazed pastures. The
       modified model fairly reproduced the real variability in
       underlying processes regulating N2O emissions and could be
       suitable for simulating N2O emissions from a range of New
       Zealand grazed pastures. The NZ-DNDC estimates of total yearly
       emissions of N2O from the grazed and ungrazed sites of both
       farms were within the uncertainty range of the measured
       emissions. The measured emissions changed with changes in soil
       moisture resulting from rainfall and were about 20\% higher in
       the poorly drained silt loam soil than in the well-drained
       sandy loam soil. The model accounts for these climatic
       variations in rainfall, and was also able to pick up
       differences in emissions resulting from differences in soil

       from typical New Zealand grazed grassland soils, and subsequent
       improvements to account for periodic changes in pasture growth,

       In grazed pastures, NO fluxes varied widely both spatially due
       to uneven excretal N inputs, and seasonally due to climatic
       conditions. The model was validated against field measurements
       from two dairy pastures with contrasting soils and from a sheep
       pasture. The model simulated effectively most of the soil
       water-filled pore-space (WFPS) and the general pulses and
       trends in NO emission from both the sheep- and dairy-grazed
       pastures, and also captured the observed effects of excretal

       arable soil, although the ratio narrowed with increasing
       temperature. Changes in soil WFPS also had a profound effect on
       emissions. Those from the arable soil increased about 30-fold
       as the WFPS increased from 60 to 80\%, while that from the
       grassland soil increased 12-fold. This latter response was
       similar to earlier field measurements. The N2O emissions were
       considered to be produced primarily by denitrification. We
       concluded that the impacts of temperature and WFPS on emissions
       could both be explained on the basis of existing models
       relating increasing respiration or decreased oxygen
       diffusivity, or both, to the development of anaerobic zones
       within the soil.},

  abstract = {Because several soil properties and processes affect emissions of
       nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils, it has
       been difficult to develop effective and robust algorithms to
       predict emissions of these gases in biogeochemical models. The
       conceptual "hole-in-the-pipe" (HIP) model has been used
       effectively to interpret results of numerous studies, but the
       ranges of climatic conditions and soil properties are often
       relatively narrow for each individual study. The Trace Gas
       Network (TRAGNET) database offers a unique opportunity to test
       the validity of one manifestation of the HIP model across a
       broad range of sites, including temperate and tropical
       climates, grasslands and forests, and native vegetation and
       agricultural crops. The logarithm of the sum of NO + N2O
       emissions was positively and significantly correlated with the
       logarithm of the sum of extractable soil NH,+ + NO3-. The
       logarithm of the ratio of NO:N2O emissions was negatively and
       significantly correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS).
       These analyses confirm the applicability of the HIP model
       concept, that indices of soil N availability correlate with the
       sum of NO+N2O emissions, while soil water content is a strong
       and robust controller of the ratio of NO:N2O emissions.
       However, these parameterizations have only broad-brush accuracy
       because of unaccounted variation among studies in the soil
       depths where gas production occurs, where soil N and water are
       measured, and other factors. Although accurate predictions at
       individual sites may still require site-specific
       parameterization of these empirical functions, the
       parameterizations presented here, particularly the one for
       WFPS, may be appropriate for global biogeochemical modeling.
       Moreover, this integration of data sets demonstrates the broad
       ranging applicability of the HIP conceptual approach for
       understanding soil emissions of NO and N2O.},

  abstract = {Forest soils are a significant source for the primary and secondary
       greenhouse gases N2O and NO. However, current estimates are
       still uncertain due to the still limited number of field
       measurements and the herein observed pronounced variability of
       N trace gas fluxes in space and time, which are due to the
       variation of environmental factors such as soil and vegetation
       properties or meteorological conditions. To overcome these
       problems we further developed a process-oriented model, the
       PnET-N-DNDC model, which simulates the N trace gas exchange on
       the basis of the processes involved in production, consumption
       and emission of N trace gases. This model was validated against
       field observations of N trace gas fluxes from 19 sites obtained
       within the EU project NOFRETETE, and shown to perform well for
       N2O (r(2) = 0.68, slope = 0.76) and NO (r(2) = 0.78, slope =
       0.73). For the calculation of a European-wide emission
       inventory we linked the model to a detailed, regionally and
       temporally resolved database, comprising climatic properties
       (daily resolution), and soil parameters, and information on
       forest areas and types for the years 1990, 1995 and 2000. Our
       calculations show that N trace gas fluxes from forest soils may
       vary substantial from year to year and that distinct regional
       patterns can be observed. Our central estimate of NO emissions
       from forest soils in the EU amounts to 98.4, 84.9 and 99.2 kt N
       yr(-1) 1, using meteorology from 1990, 1995 and year 2000,
       respectively. This is < 1.0\% of pyrogenic NOx emissions. For
       N2O emissions the central estimates were 86.8, 77.6 and 81.6 kt
       N yr(-1), respectively, which is approx. 14.5\% of the source
       strength coming from agricultural soils. An extensive
       sensitivity analysis was conducted which showed a range in
       emissions from 44.4 to 254.0 kt N yr(-1) for NO and 50.7 to
       96.9 kt N yr(-1) for N2O, for year 2000 meteorology.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide emitted by soils can be produced either by
       denitrification in anoxic conditions or by nitrification in
       presence Of O-2. The relative importance of the two processes,
       particularly under varied partial pressures Of O-2, is not
       always known. This paper focuses on the influence of O-2
       concentration on N2O production by nitrification and
       denitrification in an arable Orthic Luvisol. Soil aggregates
       (2-3 mm size), water unsaturated, received 116 mg N kg(-1) as
       ammonium sulphate labelled with N-15 and were incubated during
       14 days at different O-2 partial pressures: 0, 0.35, 0.76, 1.5,
       4.3 and 20.4 kPa. A N-15 tracing technique was used to quantify
       nitrification and denitrification rates. (N2O)-N-15 and N-15(2)
       were measured. Oxygen pressure appeared to strongly influence
       both nitrification and denitrification rates and also N2O
       emissions. Nitrification rates were reduced by a factor of 6-9
       when O-2 decreased from 20.4 to 0.35 kPa. They were highly
       correlated with O-2 consumption rates. Denitrification mainly
       occurred in complete anoxic conditions. The proportion of N2O
       emitted by denitrification was estimated by two independent
       methods: one based on N-15 tracing using isotope composition of
       NH4, NO3 and N2O, the other based on the measurement of the
       (N2O)-N-15: N-15(2) ratio. The two methods gave close results.
       The highest N2O emissions were obtained under complete anoxic
       conditions and were due to denitrification. However, N2O
       emissions almost as important were obtained at day 14 with 1.5
       kPa O-2 pressure, and they were due to nitrification.
       Nitrification was the main source of N2O at O-2 concentrations
       greater than 0.35 kPa. The amounts of N2O-N emitted by
       nitrification were linearly related to the amounts of N
       nitrified, but the slope of the regression was highly dependent
       on O-2 concentration: it varied from 0.16 to 1.48\% when O-2
       concentration was reduced from 20.4 to 0.76 kPa. Emissions of
       N2O by nitrification may then be quite significant if
       nitrification occurs at a reduced O-2 concentration. (C) 2004

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide emissions were measured from several grassland and
       arable soils in the field, and from two of these soils and a
       forest soil transferred in large monoliths to a greenhouse. The
       effects of fertiliser N additions and of soil water content and
       temperature were investigated. Emissions were in the order
       grazed grassland > grassland cut for conservation > potatoes >
       cereal crops, and generally were higher than those from
       temperate natural ecosystems. Based on these data, agricultural
       soils constitute the major soil source of N2O in the Y.K. The
       highest emission recorded was 8 kg N2O-N ha(-1) over 10 months,
       from a grazed grassland site. Emissions varied from year to
       year, depending particularly on rainfall at the time of
       fertilisation. When soil mineral N was not limiting,
       exponential relationships between N2O Aux and both water-filled
       pore space (WFPS) and temperature were observed. The Q(10)
       value for a sandy loam was 1.6, but ranged up to 12 for a clay
       loam soil at high WFPS. The high values were attributed to the
       increase in anaerobic zones where denitrification could take
       place, as respiratory demand for O-2 increased. A forest
       soil(peaty gley) showed an optimum water potential for N2O
       emission. Diurnal fluctuations in emissions were associated
       with diurnal cycles in soil temperature, but with varying time
       lags, which could be explained by the N2O being produced at
       different depths. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

  abstract = {Agricultural peat soils are important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O).
       Emissions of N2O were measured from field plots of grass,
       barley, potatoes and fallow on a peat field in northern Finland
       during 2000-2002 and in southern Finland in 1999-2002. In the
       north the mean annual fluxes of N2O (with their standard
       errors) during 2 years were 4.0 (+/-1.2), 13 (+/-3.0) and 4.4
       (+/-0.8) kg N ha(-1) from the plots of grass, barley and
       fallow, respectively. In the north there were no significant
       thaw periods in the middle of winter. As a result, the thawing
       in the spring did not induce especially large N2O emissions.
       Emissions of N2O were larger in the south than in the north. In
       the southern peat field the mean annual fluxes during 3 years
       were 7.3 (+/-1.2), 15 (+/-2.6), 10 (+/-1.9) and 25 (+/-6.9) kg
       N2O-N ha(-1) for grass, barley, potato and fallow plots,
       respectively. Here, the largest single episodes of emission
       occurred during the spring thaw each year, following winter
       thaw events. An emission factor of 10.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1)
       year(-1) for the N2O emission from the decomposition of the
       peat results from these data if the effect of fertilization
       according to the IPCC default emission factor is omitted. The
       direct effect of adding N as fertilizer on N2O emissions was of
       minor importance. On average, 52\% of the annual N2O flux
       entered the atmosphere outside the cropping season (October-
       April) in the north and 55\% in the south. The larger N2O fluxes
       from the peat soil in the south might be due to the more
       humified status of the peat, more rapid mineralization and
       weather with more cycles of freezing and thawing in the winter.},

  abstract = {To assess the influence of the pore space structure and organic matter
       on denitrification, a comparative study was performed on clods
       in a soil under cropped and pasture managements. For each
       management, the potential denitrification rate was estimated.
       Denitrification under oxic conditions was also measured on 100
       clods, which were saturated with KNO3 solution (4 g l(-1)).
       Size and density fractions of the soil were separated, and the
       C and N contents of their particulate organic matter were
       determined. Clod porosities were measured and the distributions
       of distances of any point within the clod to the nearest air-
       filled pore were estimated on 20 thin sections for each soil
       management. Potential denitrification rates were similar (105 x
       10(-11) and 98 x 10(-11) mol N2O kg(-1) dry soil s(-1) for
       pasture and cropped soil, respectively). The mean
       denitrification rate under oxic conditions was only equal to
       0.14\% of the potential denitrification rate for pasture,
       whereas it was about 2.1\% for cropped soil. The total and
       soluble organic C content was significantly higher in pasture
       than in cropped soil clods. The quantity or the quality of
       organic matter fractions did not explain the difference in
       denitrification activities. Even if macroporosity represented a
       small fraction of the total porosity in both soils, the
       differences in macropore distribution induced by soil
       management practices led to significantly different maximal
       distances between any clod point and the nearest air-filled
       pore (8 and 14 mm for pasture and cropped soils, respectively).
       Consequently, we demonstrated that the pore space structure
       appears to be the major factor explaining the difference in
       mean denitrification rates between pasture and cropped soil
       clods, while the distribution of particulate organic matter is
       suspected to be involved in the differences in denitrifying
       activity distribution between the clods of the two soils. (C)

       describe the anaerobic activity in the centres of the clods,
       but they neglect the role of particulate organic materials. We
       therefore studied the effect of particulate organic matter on
       denitrification in soil both under pasture and in arable
       cultivation. Clods were separated into two compartments: (i)
       particulate organic matter and adhering soil exceeding 200 mu m
       (coated POM), and (ii) the matrix (the rest of the soil).
       Potential denitrification and production of CO2 were then
       estimated on coated POM, matrix and unfractionated soil. The
       quantity and the quality of coated POM were assessed
       individually in 100 clods from the pasture and 100 from the
       arable land. The rate of potential denitrification was similar
       in unfractionated soil from these treatments. However, it was
       70 times greater in the coated POM than in the matrix from the
       arable soil. Production of CO2 was nine times greater in the
       coated POM than in the matrix from the pasture soil and 33
       times greater in the arable soils. These observations were the
       basis for a mechanistic model of denitrification, taking into
       account contributions from coated POM and the matrix.
       Denitrification rates in a computerized representation of clods

       explain more than half of the denitrification and most of the

       period for future climate conditions (2031-2039). The climate
       scenarios were used to drive the GIS-coupled biogeochemical
       model Photosynthesis-Evapotranspiration-Model Denitrification-
       Decomposition-Model (PnET-N-DNDC), which has currently been
       tested for its predicting capability for soil N trace gas
       emissions for various sites across Europe. The model results
       show a complex, spatially differentiated pattern of changes in
       future N2O and NO emissions from the forest soils across
       Europe, which were driven by the combined effect of changes in
       precipitation and temperature. Overall, the model predicted
       that N2O emissions from the European forest soils will on
       average decrease by 6\%. This decrease was mainly due to the
       shift in N2O:N-2 ratio driven by enhanced denitrification. NO
       emissions were found to increase by 9\%. The increases in NO
       emissions were mainly due to increases in temperature. Only for
       the regions where soil moisture was predicted to markedly
       increase or suffer from water stress during the vegetation
       period, a reduction of NO emissions was simulated. The
       simulations show the possibility and feasibility for assessing
       climate change feedbacks on biogenic N trace gas emissions from
       soils at a regional scale.},

       rates and N2O emissions by both processes were measured in

       balance of arable cropping systems through effects on soil
       physics and biology affecting soil carbon storage and nitrous
       oxide (N2O) emissions. The effects of conventional tillage (CT)
       with ploughing to 20 cm, reduced tillage (RT) with harrowing to
       8-10 cm and direct drilling (DD) on CO2 and N2O emissions from
       a loamy sand soil (8.1\% clay, 3.5\% organic matter) under spring
       barley undersown with ryegrass were measured by static chambers
       over a period of H 3 days in spring and summer 2004 in a
       tillage experiment established in 2002 at Foulum, Denmark.
       There was a high temporal and spatial variation in both CO2 and
       N2O emissions, which made the comparisons of treatment effects
       on emissions on single dates difficult. However, this variation
       was reduced when the measurements were corrected for diurnal
       variation in the emissions and when emissions were cumulated
       over a longer period. Both CO2 and N2O emissions decreased in
       the order CT > RT > DD. Compared with CT (40 kg C day(-1)) the
       cumulated CO2 emissions during the 91 days after tillage were
       21 and 25\% lower for the RT and the DD treatments,
       respectively. The cumulated N2O emission from CT over the
       entire observation period (0.89 kg N ha(-1) or 7.9 g N day(-1))
       was about twice that of DD. The N2O emissions were
       significantly higher for CT compared with DD and RT, even
       before tillage and the difference increased after tillage, but
       decreased after fertilisation. Spring barley dry matter grain
       yields were reduced by 14\% for RT and 27\% for DD compared to
       CT. Measurements of soil mineral nitrogen (N) at sowing showed
       no difference between the treatments, and could thus not
       explain the differences in N2O emissions and crop N uptake. It
       is likely that tillage affected CO2 emissions, N2O emissions
       and crop growth through different processes, where effects of
       soil compactness on root penetration and soil aeration and
       diffusivity on one side and soil organic matter turnover on the
       other side probably played key roles. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) in agricultural fertilizers is denitrified by soil
       bacteria when oxygen is limited, which effectively removes
       plant-available N from the soil to the atmosphere. Reported
       denitrification rates range from 0 to 239 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1),
       and, depending upon environmental conditions and management,
       may reduce the amount of N available for crop growth by 27\%.
       Denitrification in soils also results in emissions of nitrous
       oxide ( N2O), which is a recognized pollutant that contributes
       to stratospheric ozone destruction and radiative forcing in the
       troposphere. Practitioners of sustainable agronomy aim to
       improve plant N-use efficiency and reduce emissions of the
       greenhouse gases by synchronizing N application and plant
       nutritional requirements. However, it is difficult to predict
       denitrification rates during and after the growing season based
       on current knowledge. High rates are consistently reported in
       irrigated cropping systems following heavy applications of
       fertilizer-N, but few studies report denitrification during the
       dormant season. Denitrification in winter may represent a
       significant sink for fertilizer-N in cropping systems, but
       further research at sub-zero soil temperatures is needed. Here,
       the three factors required for microbial denitrification:
       limited O-2 availability, electron donors and electron
       acceptors, are reviewed based on soil research performed both
       above and below 0 degrees C. Gaps in the knowledge of
       denitrification rates in cropping systems, particularly when
       soils are frozen, are identified. Sustainable management of N
       in cropping systems such as greater N-use efficiency and lower
       greenhouse gas emissions could be advanced by greater

  abstract = {This paper reviews simplified process models for denitrification. More
       than fifty models were considered. The majority of these
       (simple) models are based on potential denitrification-either
       measured as a soil's property or computed from organic C
       dynamics-or consider denittification as a first-order decay
       process. As it is generally accepted that environmental soil
       conditions affect the denitrification process, reduction
       functions are used. Although denitrification is truly driven by
       the non-availability of oxygen, most authors argue that oxygen
       dynamics in soil is hard to simulate (or to measure).
       Therefore, water content is used as a complementary for oxygen
       diffusion. The higher the water content, the less oxygen will
       be present. Other factors that influence denitrification are
       nitrate-nitrogen content, soil temperature and soil acidity
       (pH). The availability of easily decomposable organic carbon
       determines the value of potential denitrification or the first-
       order decay rate constant. Although there seems to be consensus
       about the mathematical formulation of the simple process model,
       the shapes of the reduction functions differ largely between
       the models, especially for the water content reduction
       function. From a sensitivity analysis it follows that the model
       is most sensitive to the parameters of the water content
       reduction function, indicating that these parameters and the
       water content must be determined with great accuracy. (c) 2005

       data sets where parameters had been specifically derived for
       these data sets. This paper demonstrates that it may not always
       work well for other data, i.e., Dutch data sets. The model was
       parameterized for each of eight Dutch data sets, consisting of
       three sand, two heavy loam and three peat sites. After
       parameter optimisation the model is not able to predict
       individually measured actual denitrification rates. However,
       for sand and loam soils, but not for peat soils, the
       correspondence between measured and predicted average actual
       denitrification is good. This means that the calibrated model
       can predict, for those specific locations, cumulative
       denitrification rather well, provided that detailed information
       on soil conditions is available, either from measurements or
       from simulation models. The parameters and thus the reduction
       functions differed between the data sets. Parameter values
       within a class of soils, say sand, loam, and peat, were
       different. So care should be taken when using parameter values
       obtained from other studies. Albeit simple in its mathematical
       formulation, a widely used simplified denitrification process

       denitrification gas flux data and field-observed N2O gas fluxes
       from different sites. Controls over nitrification N2O gas
       fluxes are soil texture, soil NH4, soil water-filled pore
       space, soil N turnover rate, soil pH, and soil temperature.
       Observed data suggest that nitrification N2O gas fluxes are
       proportional to soil N turnover and that soil NH4 levels only
       impact N2O gas fluxes with high levels of soil NH4 (>3 mu g N
       g(-1)). Total denitrification (N-2 plus N2O) gas fluxes are a
       function of soil heterotrophic respiration rates, soil NO3,
       soil water content, and soil texture. N-2:N2O ratio is a
       function of soil water content, soil NO3, and soil
       heterotrophic respiration rates. The denitrification model was
       developed using laboratory data [Weier et al., 1993] where soil
       water content, soil NO3, and soil C availability were varied
       using a full factorial design. The Weier's model simulated
       observed N-2 and N2O gas fluxes for different soils quite well

       simulated model results with field N2O data for several

       the observed data (r(2)=0.62). Winter denitrification events
       were poorly simulated by the model. This problem could have
       been caused by spatial and temporal variations in the observed
       soil water data and N2O fluxes. The model results and observed
       data suggest that approximately 14\% of the N2O fluxes for a
       shortgrass steppe are a result of denitrification and that this
       percentage ranged from 0\% to 59\% for different sites.},

       length of the growing season of wheat and maize crops, and to
       build a model of soil NO emissions from arable land. Field
       experiments were carried out on a 1-ha field divided into two
       parts. The first one was cropped with wheat and harvested in
       late July, 2002, whereas the second part was sown with maize
       and harvested in October. The wheat and maize received 130 kg N
       ha(-1) and 140 kg N ha(-1), respectively. For each crop, NO
       fluxes were measured during 10 months every 2 weeks using
       manual closed chambers, and continuously with a wind tunnel
       immediately after nitrogen fertilization. Fertilizer
       application significantly affected NO emissions: the largest NO
       emissions were recorded a few days after nitrogen application.
       This delay depended on the kinetics of nitrogen incorporation
       in the soil, as influenced by rainfall. The emissions measured
       on the maize field (2.6\% of the fertilizer amount applied) were
       more important than those on the wheat field (1.0\% of the
       fertilizer amount applied), owing to differences in timing of
       nitrogen application, with respect to climate and crop growth.

  abstract = {Nitrifier denitrification is the pathway of nitrification in which
       ammonia (NH3) is oxidized to nitrite (NO,) followed by the
       reduction of NO2- to nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and
       molecular nitrogen (N-2). The transformations are carried out
       by autotrophic nitrifiers. Thus, nitrifier denitrification
       differs from coupled nitrification-denitrification, where
       denitrifiers reduce NO2- or nitrate (NO3-) that was produced by
       nitrifiers. Nitrifier denitrification contributes to the
       development of the greenhouse gas N2O and also causes losses of
       fertilizer nitrogen in agricultural soils. In this review
       article, present knowledge about nitrifier denitrification is
       summarized in order to give an exact definition, to spread
       awareness of its pathway and controlling factors and to
       identify areas of research needed to improve global N2O
       budgets. Due to experimental difficulties and a lack of
       awareness of nitrifier denitrification, not much is known about
       this mechanism of N2O production. The few measurements carried
       out so far attribute up to 30\% of the total N2O production to
       nitrifier denitrification. Low oxygen conditions coupled with
       low organic carbon contents of soils favour this pathway as
       might low pH. As nitrifier denitrification can lead to
       substantial N2O emissions, there is a need to quantify this
       pathway in different soils under different conditions. New
       insights attained through quantification experiments should be
       used in the improvement of computer models to define sets of
       conditions that show where and when nitrifier denitrification
       is a significant source of N2O. This may subsequently render
       the development of guidelines for low-emission farming

       concentration has almost tripled since pre-industrial
       times(1,2). It plays a central role in atmospheric oxidation
       chemistry and affects stratospheric ozone and water vapour
       levels. Most of the methane from natural sources in Earth's
       atmosphere is thought to originate from biological processes in
       anoxic environments(2). Here we demonstrate using stable carbon
       isotopes that methane is readily formed in situ in terrestrial
       plants under oxic conditions by a hitherto unrecognized
       process. Significant methane emissions from both intact plants
       and detached leaves were observed during incubation experiments
       in the laboratory and in the field. If our measurements are
       typical for short-lived biomass and scaled on a global basis,
       we estimate a methane source strength of 62 - 236 Tg yr(-1) for
       living plants and 1 - 7 Tg yr(-1) for plant litter (1 Tg =
       10(12) g). We suggest that this newly identified source may
       have important implications for the global methane budget and
       may call for a reconsideration of the role of natural methane
       sources in past climate change.},

Emission of methane with an apparently biological origin was recorded from both whole plants and detached leaves. This was the first report of methanogenesis in an aerobic setting, and was estimated to account for 10–45 per cent of the global methane source. Here, we show that plants do not contain a known biochemical pathway to synthesize methane. However, under high UV stress conditions, there may be spontaneous breakdown of plant material, which releases methane. In addition, plants take up and transpire water containing dissolved methane, leading to the observation that methane is released. Together with a new analysis of global methane levels from satellite retrievals, we conclude that plants are not a major source of the global methane production.

       2008-2012 are analysed against a business-as-usual scenario. We
       provide a quantitative estimation of the carbon absorption
       potential per hectare and the surface of agricultural land that
       is available and suitable for the implementation of those
       measures, their environmental effects as well as the effects on
       farm income. Realistically, agricultural soils in EU-15 can
       sequester up to 16-19 Mt C year(-1) during the first Kyoto
       commitment period (2008-2012), which is less than one fifth of
       the theoretical potential and equivalent to 2\% of European
       anthropogenic emissions. We identified as most promising
       measures: the promotion of organic inputs on arable land
       instead of grassland, the introduction of perennials (grasses,
       trees) on arable set-aside land for conservation or biofuel
       purposes, to promote organic farming, to raise the water table
       in fanned peatland, and-with restrictions-zero tillage or
       conservation tillage. Many options have environmental benefits
       but some risk of increasing N2O emissions. For most measures it
       is impossible to determine the overall impact on farm

       soils demands a permanent management change and implementation
       concepts adjusted to local soil, climate and management
       features in order to allow selection of areas with high carbon

       recent N2O flux data from agricultural legume crops to assess
       the emission factor associated with rhizobial nitrogen
       fixation. Average N2O emissions from legumes are 1.0 kg N
       ha(-1) for annual crops, 1.8 kg N ha(-1) for pure forage crops
       and 0.4 kg N ha(-1) for grass legume mixes. These values are
       only slightly greater than background emissions from
       agricultural crops and are much lower that those predicted
       using 1996 IPCC methodology. These field flux measurements and
       other process-level studies offer little support for the use of
       an emission factor for biological N fixation (BNF) by legume
       crops equal to that for fertiliser N. We conclude that much of
       the increase in soil N2O emissions in legume crops may be
       attributable to the N release from root exudates during the
       growing season and from decomposition of crop residues after
       harvest, rather than from BNF per se. Consequently, we propose
       that the biological fixation process itself be removed from the
       IPCC N2O inventory methodology, and that N2O emissions induced
       by the growth of legume crops be estimated solely as a function
       of crop residue decomposition using an estimate of above- and

  abstract = {No-tillage (NT) management has been promoted as a practice capable of
       offsetting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of its
       ability to sequester carbon in soils. However, true mitigation
       is only possible if the overall impact of NT adoption reduces
       the net global warming potential (GWP) determined by fluxes of
       the three major biogenic GHGs (i.e. CO2, N2O, and CH4). We
       compiled all available data of soil-derived GHG emission
       comparisons between conventional tilled (CT) and NT systems for
       humid and dry temperate climates. Newly converted NT systems
       increase GWP relative to CT practices, in both humid and dry
       climate regimes, and longer-term adoption (>10 years) only
       significantly reduces GWP in humid climates. Mean cumulative
       GWP over a 20-year period is also reduced under continuous NT
       in dry areas, but with a high degree of uncertainty. Emissions
       of N2O drive much of the trend in net GWP, suggesting improved
       nitrogen management is essential to realize the full benefit
       from carbon storage in the soil for purposes of global warming
       mitigation. Our results indicate a strong time dependency in
       the GHG mitigation potential of NT agriculture, demonstrating
       that GHG mitigation by adoption of NT is much more variable and

  abstract = {Carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is frequently promoted as a
       practical solution for slowing down the rate of increase of CO2
       in the atmosphere. Consequently, there is a need to improve our
       understanding of how land management practices may affect the
       net removal of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the atmosphere. In
       this paper we examine the role of agriculture in influencing
       the GHG budget and briefly discuss the potential for carbon
       mitigation by agriculture. We also examine the opportunities
       that exist for increasing soil C sequestration using management
       practices such as reduced tillage, reduced frequency of summer
       fallowing, introduction of forage crops into crop rotations,
       conversion of cropland to grassland and nutrient addition via
       fertilization. In order to provide information on the impact of
       such management practices on the net GHG budget we ran
       simulations using CENTURY (a C model) and DNDC (a N model) for
       five locations across Canada, for a 30-yr time period. These
       simulations provide information on the potential trade-off
       between C sequestration and increased N2O emissions. Our model
       output suggests that conversion of cropland to grassland will
       result in the largest reduction in net GHG emissions, while
       nutrient additions via fertilizers will result in a small
       increase in GHG emissions. Simulations with the CENTURY model
       also indicated that favorable growing conditions during the
       last 15 yr could account for an increase of 6\% in the soil C at
       a site in Lethbridge, Alberta.},

       considered as a potentially large source of energy supply with
       an estimated value of 47 x 10(18)J worldwide. However, there is
       some debate regarding the actual amounts of straw which could
       be removed from arable soils without jeopardizing their
       quality, as well as the potential trade-offs in the overall
       straw-to-energy chain compared to the use of fossil energy
       sources. Here, we used a deterministic model of C and N
       dynamics in soil-crop systems to simulate the effect of straw
       removal under various sets of soil, climate and crop management
       conditions in northeastern France. Model results in terms of
       nitrate leaching, soil C variations, nitrous oxide and ammonia
       emissions were subsequently inputted into the life-cycle
       assessment (LCA) of a particular bio-energy chain in which
       straw was used to generate heat and power in a plant producing
       bio-ethanol from wheat grains. Straw removal had little
       influence on simulated environmental emissions in the field,
       and straw incorporation in soil resulted in a sequestration of
       only 5-10\% of its C in the long term (30 years). The LCA
       concluded to significant benefits of straw use for energy in
       terms of global warming and use of non-renewable energy. only
       the eutrophication and atmospheric acidification impact
       categories were slightly unfavourable to straw use in some
       cases, with a difference of 8\% at most relative to straw
       incorporation. These results based on a novel methodology
       thereby confirm the environmental benefits of substituting

       between 2000 and 2015) and the largest source of greenhouse gas
       (GHG) from agriculture (about 50\% of the total emissions). The
       growth of food demand in Africa and South America will cause
       substantial increase in GHG emissions by the agri-food sector,
       unless improved management systems are adopted. The higher food
       consumption rate (kJ person(-1) day(-1)) around the world is
       primarily a result of improved crop production and higher
       percentage of animal products in diet. The latter will,
       however, result in more CH4 emissions. The growing use of N
       fertilizers is also a concern. The part not taken up by crops
       (more than 50\%) is either lost through leaching or released to

       (UNFCCC) are required to submit national greenhouse gas (GHG)
       inventories, together with information on methods used in
       estimating their emissions. Currently agricultural activities
       contribute a significant portion (approximately 20\%) of global
       anthropogenic GHG emissions, and agricultural soils have been
       identified as one of the main GHG source categories within the
       agricultural sector. However, compared to many other GHG
       sources, inventory methods for soils are relatively more
       complex and have been implemented only to varying degrees among
       member countries. This review summarizes and evaluates the
       methods used by Annex 1 countries in estimating CO, and N2O
       emissions in agricultural soils. While most countries utilize
       the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default
       methodology, several Annex 1 countries are developing more
       advanced methods that are tailored for specific country
       circumstances. Based on the latest national inventory
       reporting, about 56\% of the Annex 1 countries use IPCC Tier I
       methods, about 26\% use Tier 2 methods, and about 18\% do not
       estirnate or report N2O emissions from agricultural soils. More
       than 65\% of the countries do not report CO2 emissions from the
       cultivation of mineral soils, organic soils, or liming, and
       only a handful of countries have used country-specific, Tier 3
       methods. Tier 3 methods usually involve process-based models
       and detailed, geographically specific activity data. Such
       methods can provide more robust, accurate estimates of
       emissions and removals but require greater diligence in
       documentation, transparency, and uncertainty assessment to
       ensure comparability between countries. Availability of
       detailed, spatially explicit activity data is a major
       constraint to implementing higher tiered methods in many
       countries.},

       nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from N fertiliser applications.

       for a list of greenhouse gases including N2O. A standard
       methodology proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
       Change (IPCC) estimates direct N2O emissions from soils as a
       constant fraction (1.25\%) of the nitrogen input. This approach
       is insensitive to environmental variability. A more dynamic
       approach is needed to establish reliable N2O emission
       inventories and to propose efficient mitigation strategies. The
       objective of this paper is to develop a model that allows the
       spatial and temporal variation in environmental conditions to
       be taken into account in national inventories of direct N2O
       emissions. Observed annual N2O emission rates are used to
       establish statistical relationships between N2O emissions,
       seasonal climate and nitrogen-fertilization rate. Two empirical
       models, MCROPS and MGRASS, were developed for croplands and
       grasslands. Validated with an independent data set, MCROPS
       shows that spring temperature and summer precipitation explain
       35\% of the variance in annual N2O emissions from croplands. In
       MGRASS, nitrogen-fertilization rate and winter temperature
       explain 48\% of the variance in annual N2O emissions from
       grasslands. Using long-term climate observations (1900-2000),
       the sensitivity of the models with climate variability is
       estimated by comparing the year-to-year prediction of the model
       to the precision obtained during the validation process. MCROPS
       is able to capture interannual variability of N2O emissions
       from croplands. However, grassland emissions show very small
       interannual variations, which are too small to be detectable by
       MGRASS. MCROPS and MGRASS improve the statistical reliability
       of direct N2O emissions compared with the IPCC default
       methodology. Furthermore, the models can be used to estimate
       the effects of interannual variation in climate, climate change
       on direct N2O emissions from soils at the regional scale.},

       the environmentally relevant gaseous N compounds N2O and NO
       from nitrification and denitrification. incubation experiments
       with black earth soil under two different water contents are
       presented here. Nitrification and denitrification proceeded
       simultaneously, but the importance of these two microbial
       processes shifted depending on the water content of the soil.
       Under water-unsaturated conditions the microbial oxidation of
       NH4+ to NO3- predominated, but a reduction of NO3- also
       occurred. The emission of NO exceeded the emission of N2O by a
       factor of up to 20 at the beginning of the experiments. Under
       water-saturated conditions denitrification was the dominant
       process of N transformation in the soil. However, nitrification
       also occurred to a considerable extent. The emission of N2O was
       greater than under unsaturated conditions. The formation of NO
       could hardly be observed. N loss by molecular nitrogen from
       denitrification could be detected under saturated conditions.
       The N loss amounted to 60\% of NO3- and thereby the cumulative N
       ratio of N-2 to N2O was 3. Under either unsaturated or
       saturated conditions NO arose from NO2- or during the microbial
       oxidation of NH4+ to NO2-. However, N2O mainly formed from
       denitrification under both conditions. Furthermore, NO could
       not be observed as a precursor of N2O and the free NO2- could
       not be detected as a common N pool for the formation of N2O and
       NO. High emissions of NO could be a problem for the black earth
       soil in the semi-arid climate in central Germany, if there are
       large amounts of NH4+ in the soil after fertilisation. (C) 2000

  abstract = {The vast majority of soil N2O flux data reported in the literature was
       obtained using non-flow-through non-steady-state (NFT-NSS)
       chambers. Considerable variation in chamber methodology may
       influence N2O flux measurements, however, raising concerns
       about the reliability and accuracy of these measurements. The
       objectives of this study were to determine criteria for
       assessing the quality of soil N2O flux measurements made using
       NFT-NSS chambers, to evaluate NFT-NSS chamber methodologies
       used in the scientific literature, and to propose a minimum set
       of criteria for NFT-NSS chamber design and deployment
       methodology. We identified 16 characteristics of chamber
       methodology and developed four factors contributing to the
       quality of N2O flux measurements made using NFT-NSS chambers.
       We compiled a data set of 356 studies and evaluated the quality
       of each study against the set of characteristics and factors to
       determine the confidence in the reported N2O flux. Confidence
       in the absolute flux values reported in about 60\% of the
       studies was estimated to be very low or low due to poor
       methodologies or incomplete reporting. The confidence in flux
       measurements improved with time; however, there were still
       about 50\% of recent studies (2005-2007) with low or very low
       confidence levels. This study has shown that the quality of sod
       N2O flux measurements reported in the literature is often poor.
       While the flux data obtained may be valid for comparisons
       between situations (e.g., treatments) within a given study,
       they are often biased estimates of actual fluxes. We propose a
       minimum set of criteria for reliable soil N2O flux measurements
       using NFT-NSS chambers.},

  abstract = {The number of published N2O and NO emissions measurements is
       increasing steadily, providing additional information about
       driving factors of these emissions and allowing an improvement
       of statistical N-emission models. We summarized information
       from 1008 N2O and 189 NO emission measurements for agricultural
       fields, and 207 N2O and 210 NO measurements for soils under
       natural vegetation. The factors that significantly influence
       agricultural N2O emissions were N application rate, crop type,
       fertilizer type, soil organic C content, soil pH and texture,
       and those for NO emissions include N application rate, soil N
       content and climate. Compared to an earlier analysis the 20\%
       increase in the number of N2O measurements for agriculture did
       not yield more insight or reduced uncertainty, because the
       representation of environmental and management conditions in
       agro-ecosystems did not improve, while for NO emissions the
       additional measurements in agricultural systems did yield a
       considerable improvement. N2O emissions from soils under
       natural vegetation are significantly influenced by vegetation
       type, soil organic C content, soil pH, bulk density and
       drainage, while vegetation type and soil C content are major
       factors for NO emissions. Statistical models of these factors
       were used to calculate global annual emissions from fertilized
       cropland (3.3 Tg N2O-N and 1.4 Tg NO-N) and grassland (0.8 Tg
       N2O-N and 0.4 Tg NO-N). Global emissions were not calculated

       semi-arid regions is required to better understand global
       terrestrial N2O losses. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured
       from a rain-fed, cropped soil in a semi-arid region of south-
       western Australia for one year on a sub-daily basis. The site
       included N-fertilized (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and
       nonfertilized plots. Emissions were measured using soil
       chambers connected to a fully automated system that measured
       N2O using gas chromatography. Daily N2O emissions were low
       (-1.8 to 7.3 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1)) and culminated in an
       annual loss of 0.11 kg N2O-N ha(-1) from N-fertilized soil and
       0.09 kg N2O-N ha(-1) from nonfertilized soil. Over half (55\%)
       the annual N2O emission occurred from both N treatments when
       the soil was fallow, following a series of summer rainfall
       events. At this time of the year, conditions were conducive for
       soil microbial N2O production: elevated soil water content,
       available N, soil temperatures generally > 25 degrees C and no
       active plant growth. The proportion of N fertilizer emitted as
       N2O in 1 year, after correction for the 'background' emission
       (no N fertilizer applied), was 0.02\%. The emission factor
       reported in this study was 60 times lower than the IPCC default
       value for the application of synthetic fertilizers to land
       (1.25\%), suggesting that the default may not be suitable for
       cropped soils in semi-arid regions. Applying N fertilizer did
       not significantly increase the annual N2O emission,
       demonstrating that a proportion of N2O emitted from
       agricultural soils may not be directly derived from the
       application of N fertilizer. 'Background' emissions, resulting
       from other agricultural practices, need to be accounted for if
       we are to fully assess the impact of agriculture in semi-arid
       regions on global terrestrial N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Beside agricultural soils, tropical rainforest soils are the main
       source of atmospheric N2O. Current estimates of the global N2O
       source strength of tropical rainforest soils are still based on
       rather simplistic upscaling approaches and do have a large
       range of uncertainty. In this study, the biogeochemical
       ForestDNDC-tropica model was recalibrated and intensively
       tested on the site scale prior to inventory calculations. For
       this, the model was coupled to a newly developed global GIS
       database holding relevant information on model initialization
       and driving parameters in 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees
       resolution. On average, the mean annual N2O emission source
       strength of rainforests ecosystems worldwide for the 10-year-
       period 1991-2000 was calculated to be 1.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1)
       yr(-1). Using a total rainforest area of 10.9 x 10(6) km(2),
       this amounts to a total source strength of 1.34 Tg N yr(-1).
       The result of an initialization parameter uncertainty
       assessment using Latin Hypercube sampling revealed that the
       global source strength of N2O emissions from tropical
       rainforests may range from 0.88 to 2.37 Tg N yr(-1). Our
       calculations also show that N2O emissions do vary substantially
       on spatial and temporal scales. Regional differences were
       mainly caused by differences in soil properties, whereas the
       pronounced seasonal and interannual variability was driven by
       climate variability. Our work shows that detailed
       biogeochemical models are a valuable tool for assessing
       biosphere-atmosphere exchange even on a global scale. However,
       further progress and a narrowing of the uncertainty range do
       crucially depend on the availability of more detailed field
       measurements for model testing and an improvement of the
       quality of spatial data sets on soil and vegetation properties.},

  abstract = {In this study emissions of N2O from arable soils are summarized using
       data from long-term N2O monitoring experiments. The field
       experiments were conducted at six sites in Germany between 1992
       and 1997. The annual N-application rate ranged From 0 to 350 kg
       N ha(-1). Mineral and organic N-fertilizer applications were
       temporarily split adapted to the growth stage of each crop.
       N-fertilizer input and N-yield by the crops were used to
       calculate the In/Out-balance. The closed chamber technique was
       applied to monitor the N2O fluxes from soil into the
       atmosphere. If possible, plants were included in the covers.
       Annual N2O emission values were based on flux rate measurements
       of an entire year. The annual N2O losses ranged from 0.53 to
       16.78 kg N2O-N ha(-1) with higher N2O emissions from
       organically fertilized plots as compared to minerally
       fertilized plots. Approximately 50\% of the total annual
       emissions occurred during winter. No significant relationship
       between annual N2O emissions and the respective N-fertilization
       rate was found. This was attributed to site- and crop-specific
       effects on N2O emission. The calculation of the N2O emission
       per unit N-yield from winter cereal plots indicates that the
       site effect on N2O emission is more important than the effect
       of N-fertilization, From unfertilized soils at the sites
       Braunschweig and Timmerlah a N-yield of 60.0 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)
       and N2O emissions of 2 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) were measured. This
       high background emission was assigned to the amount and
       turnover of soil organic matter. For a crop rotation at the
       sites Braunschweig and Timmerlah the N In/Out-balance over a
       period of four years was identified as a suitable predictor of
       N2O emissions. This parameter characterizes the efficiency of
       N-fertilization for crop production and allows for
       N-mineralization from the soil.},

       emission factor methodology, based on simple empirical
       relationships, has been used to estimate carbon (C) and
       nitrogen (N) fluxes for regional and national inventories.
       However, the 2005 USEPA greenhouse gas inventory includes
       estimates of N2O emissions from cultivated soils derived from
       simulations using DAYCENT, a process-based biogeochemical
       model. DAYCENT simulated major U.S. crops at county-level
       resolution and IPCC emission factor methodology was used to
       estimate emissions for the approximately 14\% of cropped land
       not simulated by DAYCENT. The methodology used to combine
       DAYCENT simulations and IPCC methodology to estimate direct and
       indirect N2O emissions is described in detail. Nitrous oxide
       emissions from simulations of presettlement native vegetation
       were subtracted from cropped soil N2O to isolate anthropogenic
       emissions. Meteorological data required to drive DAY CENT were
       acquired from DAYMET, an algorithm that uses weather station
       data and accounts for topography to predict daily temperature
       and precipitation at I-km 2 resolution. Soils data were
       acquired from the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO).
       Weather data and dominant soil texture class that lie closest
       to the geographical center of the largest cluster of cropped
       land in each county were used to drive DAYCENT. Land management
       information was implemented at the agricultural-economic region
       level, as defined by the Agricultural Sector Model. Maps of
       model-simulated county-level crop yields were compared with
       yields estimated by the USDA for quality control. Combining
       results from DAYCENT simulations of major crops and IPCC
       methodology for remaining cropland yielded estimates of
       approximately 109 and approximately 70 Tg CO2 equivalents for

  abstract = {The Denitrification-Decompostion (DNDC) model was used to estimate the
       impact of change in management practices on N2O emissions in
       seven major soil regions in Canada, for the period 1970 to
       2029. Conversion of cultivated land to permanent grassland
       would result in the greatest reduction in N2O emissions,
       particularly in eastern Canada where the model estimated about
       60\% less N2O emissions for this conversion. About 33\% less N2O
       emissions were predicted for a change from conventional tillage
       to no-tillage in western Canada, however, a slight increase in
       N2O emissions was predicted for eastern Canada. Greater N2O
       emissions in eastern Canada associated with the adoption of no-
       tillage were attributed to higher soil moisture causing
       denitrification, whereas the lower emissions in western Canada
       were attributed to less decomposition of soil organic matter in
       no-till versus conventional tilled soil. Elimination of summer
       fallow in a crop rotation resulted in a 9\% decrease in N2O
       emissions, with substantial emissions occurring during the
       wetter fallow years when N had accumulated. Increasing
       N-fertilizer application rates by 50\% increased average
       emissions by 32\%, while a 50\% decrease of N-fertilizer
       application decreased emissions by 16\%. In general, a small
       increase in N2O emissions was predicted when N-fertilizer was
       applied in the fall rather than in the spring. Previous
       research on CO2 emissions with the CENTURY model (Smith et al.,
       2001) allowed the quantification of the combined change in N2O
       and CO2 emissions in CO2 equivalents for a wide range of
       management practices in the seven major soil regions in Canada.
       The management practices that have the greatest potential to
       reduce the combined N2O and CO2 emissions are conversion from
       conventional tillage to permanent grassland, reduced tillage,
       and reduction of summer fallow. The estimated net greenhouse
       gas (GHG) emission reduction when changing from cultivated land
       to permanent grassland ranged from 0.97 (Brown Chernozem) to
       4.24 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) y(-1) (Black Chernozem) for the seven
       soil regions examined. When changing from conventional tillage
       to no-tillage the net GHG emission reduction ranged from 0.33
       (Brown Chernozem) to 0.80 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) y(-1) (Dark Gray
       Luvisol). Elimination of fallow in the crop rotation lead to an
       estimated net GHG emission reduction of 0.43 (Brown Chernozem)
       to 0.80 Mg CO2 equiv. ha(-1) y(-1) (Dark Brown Chernozem). The
       addition of 50\% more or 50\% less N-fertilizer both resulted in
       slight increases in combined CO2 and N2O emissions. There was a
       tradeoff in GHG flux with greater N2O emissions and a
       comparable increase in carbon storage when 50\% more
       N-fertilizer was added. The results from this work indicate
       that conversion of cultivated land to grassland, the conversion
       from conventional tillage to no-tillage, and the reduction of
       summerallow in crop rotations could substantially increase C
       sequestration and decrease net GHG emissions. Based on these
       results a simple scaling-up scenario to derive the possible
       impacts on Canada's Kyoto commitment has been calculated.},

  abstract = {The DAYCENT ecosystem model (a daily version of CENTURY) and an
       emission factor (EF) methodology used by the Intergovernmental
       Panel on Climate Change were used to estimate direct and
       indirect N2O emission for major cropping systems in the USA.
       The EF methodology is currently used for the USA greenhouse gas
       inventory but process based models, such as DAYCENT, may yield
       more reliable results because they account for factors such as
       soil type, climate, and tillage intensity that are ignored by
       EF. Comparison of mean annual soil N2O flux estimated by
       DAYCENT and EF with measured data for different cropping
       systems yielded r(2) values of 0.74 and 0.67, and mean
       deviations of -6 and +13\%, respectively. At the national scale,
       DAYCENT simulation of total N2O emission was similar to 25\%
       lower than estimated using EF. For both models, N2O emission
       was highest in the central USA followed by the northwest,
       southwest, southeast, and northeast regions. The models
       simulated roughly equivalent direct N2O emission from
       fertilized crops, but EF estimated greater direct N2O emission
       than DAYCENT for N-fixing crops. DAYCENT and EF estimates of
       the gaseous component of indirect N2O emission (NO + NH3)
       differed little, but DAYCENT estimated approximately twice the
       indirect emission from NO3 leaching since it included the
       contribution of N from N-fixing crops while EF did not. DAYCENT
       simulations were also performed for no tillage cropping, pre-
       1940 crop management, and native vegetation. DAYCENT-simulated
       N2O, CO2, and CH4 fluxes were converted to CO2-C equivalents
       and combined with fuel use estimates to estimate net global
       warming potential (GWP(net)). GWP(net) for recent non-rice
       (Oryza sativa L.) major cropping was 0.43 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)
       under conventional tillage and 0.29 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under no
       tillage, for pre-industrial cropping was 0.25 Mg C ha(-1)
       yr(-1), and for native systems was -0.15 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1).
       Results from DAYCENT suggest that conversion to no tillage at
       the national scale could mitigate similar to 20\% of USA
       agricultural emission or similar to 1.5\% of total USA emission
       of greenhouse gases. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

       emissions from the agricultural soils of Belgium. Annual N2O
       emission rates are estimated with two statistical models,
       MCROPS and MGRASS, which take account of the impact of changes
       in land use, climate, and nitrogen-fertilization rate. The
       models are used to simulate the temporal trend of N2O emissions
       between 1990 and 2050 for a 10' latitude and longitude grid.
       The results are also aggregated to the regional and national
       scale to facilitate comparison with other studies and national
       inventories. Changes in climate and land use are derived from
       the quantitative scenarios developed by the ATEAM project based
       on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Special Report
       on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC-SRES) storylines. The average N2O
       flux for Belgium was estimated to be 8.6 x 10(6) kg N2O-N
       yr(-1) (STD = 2.1 x 10(6) kg N2O-N yr(-1)) for the period 1990-
       2000. Fluxes estimated for a single year (1996) give a
       reasonable agreement with published results at the national and
       regional scales for the same year. The scenario-based
       simulations of future N2O emissions show the strong influence
       of land-use change. The scenarios A1FI, B1 and B2 produce
       similar results between 2001 and 2050 with a national emission
       rate in 2050 of 11.9 x 10(6) kg N2O-N yr(-1). The A2 scenario,
       however, is very sensitive to the reduction in agricultural
       land areas (-14\% compared with the 1990 baseline), which
       results in a reduced emission rate in 2050 of 8.3 x 10(6) kg
       N2O-N yr(-1). Neither the climatic change scenarios nor the
       reduction in nitrogen fertilization rate could explain these
       results leading to the conclusion that N2O emissions from
       Belgian agricultural soils will be more markedly affected by
       changes in agricultural land areas.},

  abstract = {A mechanistic model of N2O emission from agricultural soil (
       DeNritrification-DeCoinposition-DNDC) was modified for
       application to the UK, and was used as the basis of an
       inventory of N2O emission from UK agriculture in 1990. UK-
       specific input data were added to DNDC's database and the
       ability to simulate daily C and N inputs from grazing animals
       and applied animal waste was added to the model. The UK version
       of the model, UK-DNDC, simulated emissions from 18 different
       crop types on the 3 areally dominant soils in each county.
       Validation of the model at the field scale showed that
       predictions matched observations well. Emission factors for the
       inventory were calculated from estimates of N2O emission from
       UK-DNDC, in order to maintain direct comparability with the
       IPCC approach. These, along with activity data, were included
       in a transparent spreadsheet format. Using UK-DNDC, the
       estimate of N2O-N emission from UK current agricultural
       practice in 1990 was 50.9 Gg. This total comprised 31.7 Gg from
       the soil sector, 5.9 Gg from animals and 13.2 Gg from the
       indirect sector. The range of this estimate (using the range of
       soil organic C for each soil used) was 30.5-62.5 Gg N.
       Estimates of emissions in each sector were compared to those
       calculated using the TPCC default methodology. Emissions from
       the soil and indirect sectors were smaller with the UK-DNDC
       approach than with the IPCC methodology, while emissions from
       the animal sector were larger, The model runs suggested a
       relatively large emission from agricultural land that was not
       attributable to current agricultural practices (33.8 Gg in
       total, 27.4 Gg from the soil sector). This 'background'
       component is partly the result of historical agricultural land
       use. It is not normally included in inventories of emission,
       but would increase the total emission of N2O-N from
       agricultural land in 1990 to 783 Gg. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

  abstract = {The relationship, on a global basis, between the amount of N fixed by
       chemical, biological or atmospheric processes entering the
       terrestrial biosphere, and the total emission of nitrous oxide
       (N2O), has been re-examined, using known global atmospheric
       removal rates and concentration growth of N2O as a proxy for
       overall emissions. For both the pre-industrial period and in
       recent times, after taking into account the large-scale changes
       in synthetic N fertiliser production, we find an overall
       conversion factor of 3-5\% from newly fixed N to N2O-N. We
       assume the same factor to be valid for biofuel production
       systems. It is covered only in part by the default conversion
       factor for ``direct'' emissions from agricultural crop lands (1\%)
       estimated by IPCC (2006), and the default factors for the
       ``indirect'' emissions (following volatilization/deposition and
       leaching/runoff of N: 0.35-0.45\%) cited therein. However, as we
       show in the paper, when additional emissions included in the
       IPCC methodology, e.g. those from livestock production, are
       included, the total may not be inconsistent with that given by
       our ``top-down'' method. When the extra N2O emission from biofuel
       production is calculated in ``CO2-equivalent'' global warming
       terms, and compared with the quasi-cooling effect of ``saving''
       emissions of fossil fuel derived CO2, the outcome is that the
       production of commonly used biofuels, such as biodiesel from
       rapeseed and bioethanol from corn (maize), depending on N
       fertilizer uptake efficiency by the plants, can contribute as
       much or more to global warming by N2O emissions than cooling by
       fossil fuel savings. Crops with less N demand, such as grasses
       and woody coppice species, have more favourable climate
       impacts. This analysis only considers the conversion of biomass
       to biofuel. It does not take into account the use of fossil
       fuel on the farms and for fertilizer and pesticide production,
       but it also neglects the production of useful co-products. Both
       factors partially compensate each other. This needs to be
       analyzed in a full life cycle assessment.},

       and present comparisons of simulated NOx and N2O fluxes from
       the DAYCENT ecosystem model with observations from different
       soils. The N gas flux submodel assumes that nitrification and
       denitrification both contribute to N2O and NOx emissions but
       that NOx emissions are due mainly to nitrification. N2O
       emissions from nitrification are calculated as a function of
       modeled soil NH4+ concentration, water-filled pore space
       (WFPS), temperature, pH, and texture. N2O emissions from
       denitrification are a function of soil NO3- concentration,

       calculated by multiplying total N2O emissions by a NOx:N2O
       equation which is calculated as a function of soil parameters
       (bulk density, field capacity, and WFPS) that influence gas
       diffusivity. The NOx submodel also simulates NOx emission

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is primarily produced by the microbially-mediated
       nitrification and denitrification processes in soils. It is
       influenced by a suite of climate (i.e. temperature and
       rainfall) and soil (physical and chemical) variables,
       interacting soil and plant nitrogen (N) transformations (either
       competing or supplying substrates) as well as land management
       practices. It is not surprising that N2O emissions are highly
       variable both spatially and temporally. Computer simulation
       models, which can integrate all of these variables, are
       required for the complex task of providing quantitative
       determinations of N2O emissions. Numerous simulation models
       have been developed to predict N2O production. Each model has
       its own philosophy in constructing simulation components as
       well as performance strengths. The models range from those that
       attempt to comprehensively simulate all soil processes to more
       empirical approaches requiring minimal input data. These N2O
       simulation models can be classified into three categories:
       laboratory, field and regional/global levels. Process-based
       field-scale N2O simulation models, which simulate whole
       agroecosystems and can be used to develop N2O mitigation
       measures, are the most widely used. The current challenge is
       how to scale up the relatively more robust field-scale model to
       catchment, regional and national scales. This paper reviews the
       development history, main construction components, strengths,
       limitations and applications of N2O emissions models, which
       have been published in the literature. The three scale levels

       soil cores were used to model N2O and N-2 emissions from soil

       denitrification rates are controlled by the availability in
       soil of NO3 (e(-) acceptor), labile C compounds (e(-) donor),
       and O-2 (competing e(-) acceptor). Heterotrophic soil
       respiration is used as a proxy for labile C availability while
       O-2 availability is a function of soil physical properties that
       influence gas diffusivity, soil WFPS, and O-2 demand. The
       potential for O-2 demand, as indicated by respiration rates, to
       contribute to soil anoxia varies inversely with a soil gas
       diffusivity coefficient which is regulated by soil porosity and
       pore size distribution. Model inputs include soil heterotrophic
       respiration rate, texture, NO3 concentration, and WFPS. The
       model selects the minimum of the NO3 and CO2 functions to
       establish a maximum potential denitrification rate for
       particular levels of e(-) acceptor and C substrate and accounts
       for limitation of O-2 availability to estimate daily N-2+N2O

Abstract = {{Predicting impacts of climate change or alternative management on both
   food production and environment safety in agroecosystems is drawing
   great attention in the scientific community. Most of the existing
   agroecosystem models emphasize either crop growth or soil processes.
   This paper reports the latest development of an agroecosystem model
   (Crop-DNDC) by integrating detailed crop growth algorithms with an
   existing soil biogeochemical model, DNDC (Li et al., J. Geophys, Res.
   (1992) 9759). In the Crop-DNDC model, crop growth is simulated not only
   by tracking crop physiological processes (phenology, leaf area index,
   photosynthesis, respiration, assimilate allocation, rooting processes
   and nitrogen uptake), but also by calculating water stress and nitrogen
   stress, which were closely related to soil biogeochemical processes and
   hydraulic dynamics. Crop-DNDC also quantifies crop residue incorporated
   in the soil at the end of each growing season. Thus the model has
   tightly coupled crop growth algorithms with soil biogeochemical
   components, and simulates carbon, nitrogen and water cycles in
   agroecosystems with a relatively complete scope. The model was
   validated against field measurements, including soil moisture, leaf
   area index, crop biomass and nitrogen content, and the modeled results
   were in agreement with observations on soil carbon dynamics and trace
   gas emissions as well. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that the modeled
   results in crop yield, soil carbon dynamics and trace gas emissions
   were sensitive to climate conditions, atmospheric CO, concentration and
   various farming practices. There are potentials of applying the model
   for simultaneously predicting effects of changes in climate or
   management on crop yield, soil carbon sequestration and trace gas
   emissions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {This paper describes a rain-event driven, process-oriented simulation
       model, DNDC, for the evolution of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon
       dioxide (CO2), and dinitrogen (N2) from agricultural soils. The
       model consists of three submodels: thermal-hydraulic,
       decomposition, and denitrification. Basic climate data drive
       the model to produce dynamic soil temperature and moisture
       profiles and shifts of aerobic-anaerobic conditions. Additional
       input data include soil texture and biochemical properties as
       well as agricultural practices. Between rainfall events the
       decomposition of organic matter and other oxidation reactions
       (including nitrification) dominate, and the levels of total
       organic carbon, soluble carbon, and nitrate change
       continuously. During rainfall events, denitrification dominates
       and produces N2O and N2. Daily emissions of N2O and N2 are
       computed during each rainfall event and cumulative emissions of
       the gases are determined by including nitrification N2O
       emissions as well. Sensitivity analyses reveal that rainfall
       patterns strongly influence N2O emissions from soils but that
       soluble carbon and nitrate can be limiting factors for N2O
       evolution during denitrification. During a year sensitivity
       simulation, variations ia temperature, precipitation, organic
       C, clay content, and pH had significant effects on
       denitrification rates and N2O emissions. The responses of DNDC
       to changes of external parameters are consistent with field and
       experimental results reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Estimates of long-term landscape-scale N2O emissions for greenhouse
       gas inventories are complicated by large temporal and spatial
       variability. Much of this variability is likely caused by
       topographic effects on surface and subsurface water flows. We
       hypothesized that this variability could be explained as
       degassing events during anaerobic soil conditions and during
       transitions from anaerobic to aerobic soil conditions as
       controlled by precipitation and subsequent water redistribution
       in complex landscapes. We simulated degassing events in the
       ecosystem model ecosys run in three-dimensional mode to
       simulate a fertilized agricultural field with topographic
       variation derived from a digital terrain map. N2O emissions
       modelled from two areas within the field that had received 15.5
       and 9.9 g N m(-2) as urea in May 1998 were compared with those
       measured by micrometeorological flux towers during June and
       July 1998. Modelled N2O emissions during 1998 accounted for 2.3
       and 2.0\% of urea N applied at 15.5 and 9.9 g N m(-2),
       respectively. Degassing events in the model coincided with a
       key N2O emission event measured in the field during several
       days after a rainfall in mid-June. During this event, modelled
       and measured surface fluxes rose rapidly to exceed 1 mg N m(-2)
       h(-1) for 2-3 d before declining. Emissions modelled
       concurrently at different topographic positions within the
       landscape during the emission event had coefficients of
       variation that varied over time between 30 and 180\%. Much of
       the spatial variability in modelled emissions was attributed to
       temporal differences in the progression of emission events at
       different landscape positions caused by lateral water movement.
       The magnitude of temporal and spatial variability in N2O
       emissions suggests that aggregation of flux measurements to
       regional scales should be based upon sub-daily measurements at
       representative landscape positions, rather than upon less
       frequent measurements at individual sites as currently done.
       The use of three-dimensional ecosystem models with input from
       digital terrain maps may provide a means for such aggregation
       to be conducted. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

  abstract = {Predicting the N2O flux from soils is difficult because of the complex
       interplay of the various processes involved. In this study a
       boundary line approach was used to apply results from
       mechanistic experiments to N2O flux data resulting from
       measurements on field scale in southern Germany. Boundary lines
       were fitted to the rim of the data points in scattergrams
       depicting readily obtainable soil variables against the
       measured N2O flux. The boundary Line approach is based on the
       hypothesis that this line depicts the functional dependency
       between the two variables. For determining these boundary lines
       a novel method was applied. The function best representing the
       relationship between the N2O flux and soil temperature had a
       maximum above 23 degrees C and the one between the N2O flux and
       the water filled pore space (WFPS, to represent water content)
       had a maximum at 72\% WFPS. In the range of 0-20 mg N kg(-1) the
       relationship between N2O flux and nitrate in the soil was best
       described by a linear function, whereas in the range of 0-35 mg
       N kg(-1) a Michaelis-Menten function was more appropriate. The
       boundary lines specified in this study are in agreement with
       existing theoretical concepts as well as experimental results
       obtained under controlled and field conditions as reported in
       the literature. Therefore, the boundary line approach can be
       used to improve empirical models for predicting the N2O flux in

  abstract = {The greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O emissions were quantified in a long-
       term experiment in northern France, in which no-till (NT) and
       conventional tillage (CT) had been differentiated during 32
       years in plots under a maize-wheat rotation. Continuous CO2 and
       periodical N2O soil emission measurements were performed during
       two periods: under maize cultivation (April 2003-July 2003) and
       during the fallow period after wheat harvest (August 2003-March
       2004). In order to document the dynamics and importance of
       these emissions, soil organic C and mineral N, residue
       decomposition, soil potential for CO2 emission and climatic
       data were measured. CO2 emissions were significantly larger in
       NT on 53\% and in CT on 6\% of the days. From April to July 2003
       and from November 2003 to March 2004, the cumulated CO2
       emissions did not differ significantly between CT and NT.
       However, the cumulated CO2 emissions from August to November
       2003 were considerably larger for NT than for CT. Over the
       entire 331 days of measurement, CT and NT emitted 3160 +/- 269
       and 4064 +/- 138 kg CO2-C ha(-1) respectively. The differences
       in CO2 emissions in the two tillage systems resulted from the
       soil climatic conditions and the amounts and location of crop
       residues and SOM. A large proportion of the CO2 emissions in
       NTover the entire measurement period was probably due to the
       decomposition of old weathered residues. NT tended to emit more
       N2O than CTover the entire measurement period. However
       differences were statistically significant in only half of the
       cases due to important variability. N2O emissions were
       generally less than 5 g N ha(-1) day(-1), except for a few
       dates where emission increased up to 21 g N ha(-1) day(-1).
       These N2O fluxes represented 0.80 +/- 0.15 and 1.32 +/- 0.52 kg
       N2O-N ba(-1) year(-1) for CT and NT, respectively. Depending on
       the periods, a large part of the N2O emissions occurred was
       probably induced by nitrification, since soil conditions were
       not favorable for denitrification. Finally, for the period of
       measurement after 32 years of tillage treatments, the NT system
       emitted more greenhouses gases (CO2 and N2O) to the atmosphere
       on an annual basis than the CT system. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a high
       contribution from agricultural soils and emissions that depend
       on soil type, climate, crops and management practices. The N2O
       emissions therefore need to be included as an integral part of
       environmental assessments of agricultural production systems.
       An algorithm for N2O production and emission from agricultural
       soils was developed and included in the FASSET whole-farm
       model. The model simulated carbon and nitrogen (N) turnover on
       a daily basis. Both nitrification and denitrification was
       included in the model as sources for N2O production, and the
       N2O emissions depended on soil microbial and physical
       conditions. The model was tested on experimental data of N2O
       emissions from grasslands in UK, Finland and Denmark, differing
       in climatic conditions, soil properties and management. The
       model simulated the general time course of N2O emissions and
       captured the observed effects of fertiliser and manure
       management on emissions. Scenario analyses for grazed and cut
       grasslands were conducted to evaluate the effects of soil
       texture, climatic conditions, grassland management and N
       fertilisation on N2O emissions. The soils varied from coarse
       sand to sandy loam and the climatic variation was taken to
       represent the climatic variation within Denmark. N fertiliser
       rates were varied from 0 to 500 kg N ha(-1). The simulated N2O
       emissions showed a non-linear response to increasing N rates
       with increasing emission factors at higher N rates. The
       simulated emissions increased with increasing soil clay
       contents. N2O emissions were slightly increased at higher
       temperatures, whereas increasing annual rainfall generally lead
       to decreasing emissions. Emissions were slightly higher from
       grazed grasslands compared with cut grasslands at similar rates
       of total N input (fertiliser and animal excreta). The results
       indicate higher emission factors and thus higher potentials for
       reducing N2O emissions for intensively grazed grasslands on
       fine textured soils than for extensive cut-based grasslands on
       sandy soils.},

  abstract = {Estimation of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from arable soils, in
       relation to crop fertilization, is essential to devise
       strategies to mitigate the impact of agriculture on global
       warming. This paper presents the development and test of a N2O
       model resulting from the linkage of a dynamic soil-crop
       simulation model (CERES) with two sub-models of N2O production
       and reduction in soils. These sub-models (NOE and NGAS) account
       for both the nitrification and denitrification pathways. The
       resulting models (CERES NOE and CERES-NGAS) were tested against
       experimental data collected on three contrasting wheat-cropped
       soils representative of the Beauce agricultural region in
       France. Although the input variables for the N2O modules were
       correctly simulated, CERES-NGAS was over-responsive to soil
       water content in a Haplic Calcisol, and strongly over-estimated
       the N2O fluxes as a result. On the other hand, CERES-NOE
       predicted correct mean N2O emission levels for all sites, but
       failed to simulate the peak fluxes observed in the weeks
       following fertilizer application in the most N2O-productive
       soil. Both models achieved root mean squared errors in the 23-
       26 g N-N2O ha(-1) day(-1) range, significantly higher than the
       average experimental error on the measurements. On the other
       hand, their mean deviations were acceptable, being lower than
       2.2 g N-N2O ha(-1) day(-1), compared with a mean observed flux
       of 7.9 g N-N2O ha(-1) day(-1). Overall, the response of CERES-
       NOE to soil type was more accurate, but this came at the cost
       of costly, site-specific characterization on the soils'
       biological properties. The development of pedo-transfer
       functions to infer these parameters from basic soil
       characteristics appears as a pre-requisite for the use of
       CERES-NOE on a wider scale.},

       the western USA, is an important source of N2O emissions.
       However, the impacts of tillage intensity and N fertilizer
       amount and type have not been extensively studied for irrigated
       systems. The DAYCENT biogeochemical model was tested using N2O,
       crop yield, soil N and C, and other data collected from
       irrigated cropping systems in northeastern Colorado during 2002
       to 2006. DAYCENT uses daily weather, soil texture, and land
       management information to simulate C and N fluxes between the
       atmosphere, soil, and vegetation. The model property
       represented the impacts of tillage intensity and N fertilizer
       amount on crop yields, soil organic C (SOC), and soil water
       content. DAYCENT N2O emissions matched the measured data in
       that simulated emissions increased as N fertilization rates
       increased and emissions from no-till (NT) tended to be lower on
       average than conventional-till (CT). However, the model
       overestimated N2O emissions. Lowering the amount of N2O emitted
       per unit of N nitrified from 2 to 1\% helped improve model fit
       but the treatments receiving no N fertilizer were still
       overestimated by more than a factor of 2. Both the model and
       measurements showed that soil NO3- levels increase with N
       fertilizer addition and with tillage intensity, but DAYCENT
       underestimated NO3- levels, particularly for the treatments
       receiving no N fertilizer. We suggest that DAYCENT could be
       improved by reducing the background nitrification rate and by
       accounting for the impact of changes in microbial community

       static chamber method was used throughout. Emissions varied
       widely throughout the year at each site, and between sites.
       Daily fluxes up to 1200 g N-2 O-N ha (- 1) d (- 1) were
       recorded. The highest annual flux was 27.6 kg N-2 O-N ha (- 1)
       at a grassland site in Wales, whereas the lowest, 1.7 kg N-2
       O-N ha (- 1) , occurred on a soil overlying chalk in southern
       England. The key factors affecting N-2 O emissions from
       agricultural soil were soil WFPS, temperature and soil NO3 (-)
       -N content. On grassland, rainfall (particularly around the
       time of N application), with its consequent effect on water-
       filled pore space (WFPS), was the main driving factor during
       the growing season. Annual emission factors (EFs), uncorrected
       for background emission, varied from 0.4 to 6.5\% of the
       nitrogen (N) applied, covering a similar range for grassland to
       that found previously for sites restricted to Scotland.
       Continued monitoring at a grassland reference site near
       Edinburgh showed that annual EFs vary greatly from year to
       year, even with similar management, and that several years'
       data are required to produce a robust mean EF. The overall
       distribution of EFs in this and previous studies was log-
       normal. The EFs for small-grain cereals (and oilseed rape)
       peaked at a much lower value than those for grassland, whereas
       the values for leafy vegetables and potato crops fitted well
       into the grassland distribution. These differences in EF
       between various types of crop should be taken into account when

       decomposition (DNDC) model consists of two components. The
       first component, consisting of the soil climate, crop growth,
       and decomposition submodels, predicts soil temperature,
       moisture, pH, Eh, and substrate concentration profiles based on
       ecological drivers (e.g., climate, soil, vegetation, and
       anthropogenic activity). The second component, consisting of
       the nitrification, denitrification, and fermentation submodels,
       predicts NH3, NO, N2O, and CH4 fluxes based on the soil
       environmental variables. Classical laws of physics, chemistry,
       or biology or empirical equations generated from laboratory
       observations were used in the model to parameterize each
       specific reaction. The entire model links trace gas emissions
       to basic ecological drivers. Through validation against data
       sets of NO, N2O, CH4, and NH3 emissions measured at four
       agricultural sites, the model showed its ability to capture
       patterns and magnitudes of trace gas emissions.},

       (MT oats), and a conventionally tilled field cropped with maize
       (CT maize). Nitrous oxide losses from the MT maize and MT oats
       fields (5.27 and 3.64 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively) were
       significantly higher than those from the CT maize field (0.27
       kg N2O-N ha(-1)) over a period of 1 year. The lower moisture
       content in CT maize (43\% water-filled pore space [WFPS]
       compared to 60 -65\%) probably caused the difference in total
       N2O emissions. Denitrification was found to be the major source
       of N2O loss. Emission factors calculated from the MT field data
       were high (0.04) compared to the CT field (0.001). All data
       were simulated with the denitrification decomposition model
       (DNDC). For the CT field, N2O and N2O+N-2 emissions were
       largely overestimated. For the MT fields, there was a better
       agreement with the total N2O and N2O+N-2 emissions, although
       the N2O emissions from the MT maize field were underestimated.
       The simulated N2O emissions were particularly influenced by
       fertilization, but several other measured N2O emission peaks
       associated with other management practices at higher WFPS were
       not captured by the model. Several mismatches between simulated
       and measured NH4+, NO3-and WFPS for all fields were observed.
       These mismatches together with the insensitivity of the DNDC
       model for increased N2O emissions at the management practices
       different from fertilizer application explain the limited
       similarity between the simulated and measured N2O emissions

       from crop residue. However, the importance of this effect and
       its main controlling variables are largely unknown. The main
       objective of this study was to determine under which conditions
       and to what extent earthworm activity impacts N2O emissions
       from grass residue. For this purpose we initiated a 90-day
       (experiment I) and a 50-day (experiment II) laboratory mesocosm
       experiment using a Typic Fluvaquent pasture soil with silt loam
       texture. In all treatments, residue was applied, and emissions
       of NO and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured. In experiment I
       the residue was applied on top of the soil surface and we
       tested (a) the effects of the anecic earthworm species
       Aporrectodea longa (Ude) vs. the epigeic species Lumbricus
       rubellus (Hoffmeister) and (b) interactions between earthworm
       activity and bulk density (1.06 vs. 1.61 g cm(-3)). In
       experiment II we tested the effect of L. rubellus after residue
       was artificially incorporated in the soil. In experiment 1, N2O
       emissions in the presence of earthworms significantly increased
       from 55.7 to 789.1 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil (L. rubellus; p <
       0.001) or to 227.2 mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil (A. longa, p < 0.05).
       This effect was not dependent on bulk density. However, if the
       residue was incorporated into the soil (experiment II) the
       earthworm effect disappeared and emissions were higher (1064.2
       mu g N2O-N kg(-1) soil). At the end of the experiment and after
       removal of earthworms, a drying/wetting and freezing/thawing
       cycle resulted in significantly higher emissions of NO and CO2
       from soil with prior presence of L. rubellus. Soil with prior
       presence of L. rubellus also had higher potential
       denitrification. We conclude that the main effect of earthworm
       activity on N2O emissions is through mixing residue into the
       soil, switching residue decomposition from an aerobic and low
       denitrification pathway to one with significant denitrification
       and NO production. Furthermore, A. longa activity resulted in
       more stable soil organic matter than L. rubellus. (c) 2007

       NO3- and water-filled pore space (WFPS) and total N2O
       emissions. Several soil and crop input parameter adjustments to
       the model were evaluated but only the recalculation of the WFPS
       at wilting point and at field capacity, using pedotransfer
       functions, resulted in a clear improvement of the simulated
       variables (WFPS in all cases, N2O in some cases). Therefore,
       only this adjustment was made to DNDC 8.3P. This change,
       however, resulted for some cases (both cropland and grassland)
       in retardation of nitrate leaching and to a lesser extent of
       NH4+ to the deeper soil layers. The goodness of fit of the
       simulated temporal pattern of N2O varied considerably between
       sites. The total simulated N2O emissions from cropland showed a
       good agreement with the measurements, although there was a
       systematic overestimation of 7.4 kg N2O-N ha(-1). Grassland
       soils, in contrast, gave a low agreement between total

       data a regional emission factor of 3.16 with a 95\% confidence

       -237.8 to 28.6\%. However, some discrepancies existed between
       observed and simulated seasonal patterns of CH4 and N2O
       emissions. The model simulated zero N2O emissions from
       continuously flooded rice fields and poorly simulated CH4
       emissions from Allahabad site. For all other simulated cases,

       method for two adjacent forests located at the southern
       boundary of European taiga in Russia in 1999-2004. The two
       spruce forests shared similar vegetation composition but
       differed in soil conditions. The wet spruce forest (WSF)
       possessed a thick peat layer (60 cm) with a high water table
       seasonally close to or above the soil surface. The dry spruce
       forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a
       deep water table (> 60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE
       fluxes (2000 and 1440 kgC ha(-1) yr(-1) for WSF and DSF,
       respectively) indicated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink
       of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during the experimental
       years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the
       study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year
       average NEE fluxes were 1800 and -2200 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for
       WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with
       observations. The modeled data also showed high soil
       heterotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the
       water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in
       determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland
       ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-
       DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results
       indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to
       the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF
       ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO2; while along
       with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded
       period reduced and more organic matter in the soil profile
       suffered from rapid decomposition that gradually converted the
       ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO2. The general effect
       of water table variation on wetland carbon balance observed
       from this modeling study could be applicable for a wide range
       of wetland ecosystems that have accumulated soil organic carbon

       pore space (WFPS) and at 10, 15, and 20 degrees C with or
       without addition of 10\% acetylene, The amount of N2O Lost at
       72\% WFPS corresponded to 8 to 22\% of the slurry's NH4+ content,
       but to only 0.01 to 0.9\% at 43 to 57\% WFPS. Denitrification
       losses at 72\% WFPS accounted for 17 to 58\% of the slurry's NH4+
       content, but for only 0.01 to 1.2\% at 43 to 57\% WFPS. The
       amount of available C accounted for by denitrification was 8 to
       16\% of total respiration at 72\% WFPS, but only 0.03 to 0.4\% at
       43 to 57\% WFPS. Both N2O production and denitrification peal;ed
       earlier in the cattle-slurry treated soil than in the pig-
       slurry treated soil, whereas the total N loss was greatest from
       the latter. Neither amendments nor soil water contents seemed
       to affect the Q(10)-values for the CO2 production, resulting in
       values between 1.6 and 1.6. At 72\% WFPS, N2O production and
       denitrification had Q(10)-values ranging between 3.3 and 5.4.
       High temperatures enhanced both aerobic respiration and
       denitrification, and aerobic respiration further enhanced
       denitrification by consuming oxygen, resulting in strong
       sensitivity of denitrification to temperature.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) are important greenhouse gases
       (GHG) produced respectively by the naturally occurring
       microbial processes of incomplete denitrification or
       nitrification and methanogenesis. Tillage practices and climate
       affect the release of GHGs. No tillage (DMC) systems may
       increase CO2-C fixation in soil but also N2O and CH4 emissions.
       The aim of this article is to question whether the positive
       effect of a DMC system observed on carbon storage for the
       topsoil layer in Cerrado soils is offset or not by the N2O
       and/or CH4 emissions. Two 5-year-old systems, tillage (disc on
       the first 15 cm called offset: OFF) and a direct-sowing mulch-
       based crop system (DMC) with an additional cover crop were
       studied during a cropping cycle. N2O and CH4 fluxes are
       determined using a closed-chamber, N2O and CO2 concentrations
       are measured at 3 depths (10-, 20- and 30 cm). No significant
       difference between treatments was observed for both gases (for
       emissions and concentrations). Soil NO contents increase from
       surface to depth (30 cm) and range from 300 ppbv to 3 ppm for
       both treatments. Total annual estimated emissions of N2O range
       from 31 to 35 g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) for DMC and OFF
       respectively which is low and corresponds only to 0.03\% of he
       total N-fertilizer applied. Monthly means N2O emissions were
       strongly correlated to monthly means of N2O content at 10 cm
       depth (R-2 = -0.66) and seem to increase exponentially with
       monthly mean Water Filled Pore Space WFPS (0-10 cm layer) (R-2
       = 0.33). CH4 fluxes were very low as well: both treatment act
       as source of CH4 (245 and 403 g CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1) for DMC
       and OFF respectively. On a CO-C equivalent basis these results
       correspond to 4.1 and 4.7 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) for NO and
       to 1.9 and 3.1 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) for CH4 for DMC and OFF
       respectively. As a result, the carbon sequestration balance
       taking into account the CO2, CH4 and N2O on a CO2-C equivalent
       basis is in favour of DMC treatment considering that this
       treatment increases carbon storage originated from CO-C for the
       topsoil (0-10 cm) layer (350 kg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in
       comparison with OFF treatment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract = {The experiment, carried out on a forest and arable light-textured
       soil, was designed to study the temperature response of
       autotrophic and heterotrophic N2O production and investigate
       how the N2O flux relates to soil respiration and O-2
       consumption. Although N2O production seemed to be stimulated by
       a temperature increase in both soils, the relationship between
       production rate and temperature was different in the two soils.
       This seemed to depend on the different contribution of
       nitrification and denitrification to the overall N2O flux. In
       the forest soil, almost all N2O was derived from nitrification,
       and its production rate rose linearly from 2 degreesC to 40
       degreesC. A stronger effect of temperature on N2O production
       was observed in the arable soil, apparently as a result of an
       incremental contribution of denitrification to the overall N2O
       flux with rising temperature. The soil respiration rate
       increased exponentially with temperature and was significantly
       correlated with N2O production. O-2 consumption stimulated
       denitrification in both soils. In the arable soil, N2O and N-2
       production increased exponentially with decreasing O-2
       concentration, though N2O was the main gas produced at any
       temperature. In the forest soil, only the N-2 flux was related
       exponentially to O-2 consumption and it outweighed the rate of
       N2O production only at >34 degreesC. Thus, it appears that in
       the forest soil, where nitrification was the main source of
       N2O, temperature affected the N2O flux less dramatically than
       in the arable soil, where a temperature increase strongly
       stimulated N2O production by enhancing favourable conditions

  abstract = {About 65\% of all emissions of nitrous oxide, N2O, are from soils, and
       are caused by aerobic nitrification and anaerobic
       denitrification. Tropical forest soils are probably the most
       important single source, followed by cultivated soils. Emission
       rates in natural systems are related to the rate of N
       mineralization from organic matter, and N deposition; in
       agricultural systems they are related to the quantities of N
       used as fertilizers and, where relevant, to recent land use
       change. The global budget for N2O is not well balanced, and
       sources may still be underestimated. Direct evidence of a
       positive feedback of global warming on N2O emissions comes from
       studies of air in ice cores. One of the projected effects of
       future global warming is a lowering of water tables in northern
       peatlands; experiments suggest that this would lead to
       increased emissions, but that the effect on total emissions
       would be small. The results of many experiments with non-
       peatland soils indicate that the effect of temperature on soil
       emissions is generally positive, and that the rate of increase
       may be very steep when denitrification is the principal process
       involved. process-level modelling suggests that the reason is
       increased soil respiration, which causes an increase in
       anaerobic volume in which denitrification can take place, in
       addition to the increased denitrification rate per unit
       anaerobic volume brought about directly by the rise in
       temperature. These results imply that generally a positive
       feedback on emissions from soils is likely. However, in some
       environments, a large proportion of total annual emissions can
       occur during freeze-thaw cycles; such cycles may become more or
       less frequent, depending on the climatic zone, and this may
       result in either a positive or negative feedback effect due to
       global warming. Models of global and regional trends give very
       conflicting predictions of the direction and the magnitude of
       climatic impacts on fluxes, but the prediction of a positive
       feedback seems to be the more soundly based.},

       mineral nitrogen and temperature status. Intact soil cores
       (0-10 cm) were incubated for 2 weeks at 25 degrees C at either
       75\% or 60\% water-filled pore space (WFPS) with N-15-labeled
       fertilizers (100 mg N kg(-1) soil). Gas and soil samples were
       collected at 1-4 day intervals during the incubation period.
       The N2O and CO2 fluxes were measured by a gas chromatography
       (GC) system while total N-2 and N2O losses and their N-15 mole
       fractions in the soil mineral N pool were determined by a mass
       spectrometer. The daily accumulative fluxes of N-2 and N2O were
       significantly affected by tillage, N source and soil moisture.
       We observed higher (P < 0.05) fluxes of N-2+N2O, N2O and CO2
       from the NT soils than from the CT soils. Compared with the
       addition of nitrate (NOD, the addition of ammonium (NH4+)
       enhanced the emissions of these N and C gases in the CT and NT

       evident only at 60\% WFPS, indicating that nitrification and
       subsequent denitrification contributed largely to the gaseous N
       losses and N2O emission under the lower moisture condition.
       Total and fertilizer-induced emissions of N-2 and/or N2O were

       (N2O) has been well established. The current global estimate of
       the contribution of N2O to total anthropogenic greenhouse gas
       emissions from agriculture is about 69\%. Considerable progress
       has been made over the past few years in developing tools for
       quantifying the emissions from agricultural sources, at the
       local and field scale (i.e., chamber and tower-based
       measurements) as well as at the landscape and regional levels
       (i.e., aircraft-based measurement and modelling). However,
       aggregating these emissions over space and time remains a
       challenge because of the high degree of temporal and spatial
       variability. Emissions of N2O in temperate climate are largely
       event driven, e.g., in Eastern Canada, large emissions are
       observed right after snowmelt. The average emissions during the
       snowmelt period vary considerably, reflecting the influence of
       many controlling factors. Cumulative emissions reported here
       range from 0.05 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in Western Canada to 1.26 kg
       N2O-N ha-1 in Eastern Canada, values that reflect differences
       in climatic zones and fertilizer management practices. This
       paper describes the tools for refining the global N2O budget
       and provides examples of measurements at various scales. Tower-
       based and aircraft measurement platforms provide good data for
       quantifying the variability associated with the measurements.
       Chamber-based methods lack the temporal and spatial resolution
       required to follow the event driven nature of N2O fluxes but
       provide valuable information for evaluating management
       practices. The model DeNitrification and DeComposition is an
       example of a technique to estimate N2O emissions when no data

       fertilizers requires an understanding of bow those inputs
       affect the biological processes from which these emissions are
       generated. We propose a detailed model of soil N
       transformations as part of the ecosystem model ecosys for use
       in attributing N2O emission factors to fertilizer use. In this
       model, the key biological processes-mineralization,
       immobilization, nitrification, denitrification, root, and
       mycorrhizal uptake - controlling the generation of N2O were
       coupled with the key physical processes-convection, diffusion,
       volatilization, dissolution-controlling the transport of the
       gaseous reactants and products of these biological processes.
       Physical processes controlling gaseous transport and solubility
       caused large temporal variation in the generation and emission
       of N2O in the model. This variation limited the suitability of
       discontinuous surface flux chambers measurements used to test
       modeled N2O emissions. Continuous flux measurements using
       micrometeorological techniques were better suited to the
       temporal scales at which variation in N2O emission occurred and
       at which motel testing needed to be conducted. In a temperate.,
       humid climate, modeled N2O emissions rose nonlinearly with
       fertilizer application rate once this rate exceeded the crop
       and soil uptake capacities for added N. These capacities were
       partly determined by history of fertilizer use, so that the
       relationship between N2O emissions and carrent N inputs
       depended on earlier N inputs. A scheme is proposed in which N2O
       emission factors rise nonlinearly with fertilizer N inputs that
       exceed crop plus soil N uptake capacities.},

  abstract = {Although mechanistic soil-crop models are increasingly accepted as
       valuable tools in analysing agronomical or environmental
       issues, potential users are faced with an equally increasing
       number of available models. In principle, model selection
       should be based on a rational assessment of its merit with
       respect to the objectives pursued. Such information may be
       obtained by comparing the ability of candidate models to
       predict given sets of experimental data. However, because the
       basic components of soil-crop models interact strongly in
       producing model outputs, little can be drawn as to the validity
       of the approaches used for the individual components. Here, we
       focused on the soil carbon and nitrogen turnover module of four
       soil-crop models (CERES, NCSOIL, SUNDIAL, and STICS), which
       were selected based on their representativity of currently used
       models, and the range of complexity and process approaches they
       offered. The C-N modules of models other than CERES were
       extracted and linked within CERES, so that they were all
       supplied with the same physical and chemical data. Inputs and
       outputs other than those involved the N cycle were provided
       with good reliability by the common CERES shell. The
       performance of the various modules was assessed according to
       two criteria: short-term response of topsoil inorganic N to
       climate and crop residues input, and long-term dynamics of soil
       organic matter (SOM). Accordingly, data sets involving net
       mineralization and topsoil inorganic N dynamics under
       contrasting bare or wheat-cropped soils, and long-term soil
       carbon data were used to test them. The results highlight a
       trade-off between the prediction of N mineralization in the
       short-term (day to year) and SOM dynamics in the long-term
       (year to decade). On a yearly basis, NCSOIL over-estimated
       immobilization of inorganic N associated with the decomposition
       of crop residues, and CERES predicted extremely low
       mineralization fluxes. STICS and SUNDIAL gave good predictions
       of soil N supply, but over-estimated the rate at which soil
       carbon from slow-turnover pools was degraded as a result.
       Comparison with a model dedicated to predicting SOM turnover
       (RothC) showed that the discrepancy may be attributed to a
       strong under-estimation of the turnover of below-ground plant
       material by the plant modules of CERES. Crop models should thus
       be improved from this point of view before coupling with SOM
       models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Linking environmental computer simulation models and geographic
       information systems (GIS) is now a common practice to scale up
       simulations of complex ecosystem processes for decision
       support. Unfortunately, several important issues of upscaling
       using GIS are rarely considered; in particular scale dependency
       of models, availability of input data, support of input and
       validation data, and uncertainty in prediction including error
       propagation from the GIS. We linked the biogeochemical Forest-
       DNDC model to a GIS database to predict growth of Eucalyptus
       globulus plantations at two different scales (similar to 0.045
       ha plot(-1) scale and similar to 100 ha grid(-1) scale) across
       Victoria, in south-eastern Australia. Results showed that
       Forest-DNDC was not scale dependent across the range of scales
       investigated. Reduced availability of input data at the larger
       scale may introduce severe prediction errors, but did not
       require adjustment of the model in this study. Differences in
       the support of input and validation data led to an
       underestimation of predictive precision but an overestimation
       of prediction accuracy. Increasing data support, produced a
       high level of prediction accuracy ((-)e\%), but a medium level
       of predictive precision (r(2)=0.474, ME=0.318) after
       statistical validation. GIS error contribution could be

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm, Nitrous Oxide Emission (NOE) for
       simulating the emission of the greenhouse gas N2O from
       agricultural soils. N2O fluxes are calculated as the result of
       production through denitrification and nitrification and
       reduction through the last step of denitrification. Actual
       denitrification and nitrification rates are calculated from
       biological parameters and soil water-filled pore space,
       temperature and mineral nitrogen contents. New suggestions in
       NOE consisted in introducing (1) biological site-specific
       parameters of soil N2O reduction and (2) reduction of the N2O
       produced through nitrification to N-2 through denitrification.
       This paper includes a database of 64 N2O fluxes measured on the
       field scale with corresponding environmental parameters
       collected from five agricultural situations in France. This
       database was used to test the validity of this algorithm. Site
       per site comparison of simulated N2O fluxes against observed
       data leads to mixed results. For 80\% of the tested points,
       measured and simulated fluxes are in accordance whereas the
       others resulted in an important discrepancy. The origin of this
       discrepancy is discussed. On the other hand, mean annual fluxes
       measured on each site were strongly correlated to mean
       simulated annual fluxes. The biological site-specific parameter
       of soil N2O reduction introduced into NOE appeared particularly
       useful to discriminate the general level of N2O emissions from
       site to site. Furthermore, the relevance of NOE was confirmed
       by comparing measured and simulated N2O fluxes using some data
       from the US TRAGNET database. We suggest the use of NOE on a

The model, which includes the major processes determining inputs, transformations and outputs of nitrogen in arable soils, represents a scale compatible with information generally available in agricultural field research. The denitrification part of the model includes a field potential denitrification rate and functions for the effect of soil aeration status, soil temperature and soil nitrate content. Easily metabolizable organic matter is assumed not to limit denitrification. Simulated values were compared with denitrification measurements made during two growing seasons in the barley and grass ley treatments of a field experiment in central Sweden.
Calibration revealed that the optimal parameter values describing the effect of soil aeration on denitrification rates were similar for both treatments. The response function derived agreed well with two data sets found in the literature. The potential denitrification rate constant, derived in the simulations, was higher for grass ley than for barley, which was consistent with the differences in overall rates of carbon and nitrogen turnover found between treatments.
The simulated mean denitrification rates for the two seasons were within 20% of the mean of the measured values. However, simulated denitrification showed less temporal variability and a less skewed frequency distribution than measured denitrification. Some of the measured denitrification events not explained by the model could have been due to the stimulating effects of soil drying/wetting and freezing/thawing on microbial activity.},

       experiment included four treatments: a bare (crop-absent) soil
       treated with 150 kg N ha(-1) (WN150) and soils fertilized with
       0 (N0), 150 (N 150), and 250 (N250) kg N ha(-1) and cropped
       with maize or wheat. The bulk of the N2O emissions occurred in
       pulses following the application of fertilizer N at soil
       temperatures of 15 degrees C or more. The application of
       fertilizer N significantly increased the N2O emission, from 636
       g N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) in the N0 treatment to 4480 g N2O-N
       ha(-1) year(-1) in the N250 treatment. However, this increase
       primarily occurred during the maize growing season. The
       emission factor of applied fertilizer N as N2O was 1.05-1.34\%
       and 0.24-0.26\% during the 105-day maize and 241-day wheat
       growing seasons, respectively, and was on average 0.61-0.77\%.
       Increasing the rate of fertilizer application increased the
       emission factor during the maize growing season. The presence
       of maize appears to increase N2O emission by 45\% versus bare
       soil during the maize growing season. And, N2O emission during
       the maize season were significantly related to CO, production
       (R=0.43-0.81, n=30, P < 0.05). N2O emission was greatly
       affected by soil moisture during the maize growing season and
       by soil temperature during the wheat growing season. The
       maximum rates of nitrification occurred when soil moisture was
       in the range of 45-60\% WFPS, with the optimum value being
       approximately 50\%. However, soil moisture influenced N2O
       emission only when the soil temperature was at the optimum
       level. It is suggested that reducing the application rate of
       basal fertilizer N during the maize growing season could
       decrease N2O emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

       processes in soils, and contributes to global warming and
       stratospheric ozone depletion. Laboratory experiments with six
       soils ranging in clay content between 4-12\% were designed to
       investigate the effect of water and temperature on the
       partitioning of N2O from denitrification and nitrification. The
       nitrification rates at 70\% field capacity (FC) were
       significantly higher in the loamy soils (980-1440 mu g N kg(-1)
       soil day(-1)) than in the sandy soils (60-460 mu g N kg(-1)
       soil day(-1) ). The nitrous oxide produced by nitrification
       differed similarly between the soil types resulting in ratios
       of N2O-N relative to NO3--N, which were only ranging from 0.28
       to 0.48\% with an average of 0.39\%, indicating a rather constant
       relationship between nitrifrcation and nitrous oxide emission.
       Maximum nitrification rates occured at 20 degrees C and 100\%
       fired capacity (FC) and was 1/3 at 40\% FC. At lower
       temperatures only small responses to changes in soil moisture
       were observed. The percentage of N2O-N produced by
       nitrification increased with increasing soil moisture (0.49\% at

       The denitrification activity (N-2 + N2O) in the sandy loam soil
       responded significantly to both increased soil moisture and
       increased temperature, whereas the coarse sandy soil only
       reacted to increased temperature. In the coarse sandy soil the

       exponentially with increasing temperature, which implies a
       linear relationship between the Iog(N-2 to N2O ratio) and the

abstract = {Soil physical properties often regulate aeration-dependent microbial activities important to nutrient cycling, soil fertility and environmental quality. Microbial activity depends on soil water content and is maximum at a water content where the limiting effects of substrate diffusion and O2 supply are equal. The mechanism whereby this occurs and predictions of the soil water content where aerobic microbial activity is a maximum were the objectives of this study. In particular, this study predicted the shape of the microbial activity vs. water content function from soil physical concepts. Soil physical processes are assumed to influence microbial activity by limiting the steady flux of a required substrate or O2 to sites of microbial activity. Steady-state flux relations are used to define the activity function. The dependence of diffusion coefficient on water content or air-filled porosity is assumed. With these assumptions, it is possible to show that a maximum in the activity function exists. The predicted shape of the activity curve is consistent with experimental observations. The relationship between aeration-dependent microbial activity and soil water content facilitates evaluating the indirect effects of soil management practices, such as tillage, on microbial activity.

abstract = {The percentage of soil pore space filled with water (percent water-filled pores, % WFP), as determined by water content and total porosity, appears to be closely related to soil microbial activity under different tillage regimes. Soil incubated in the laboratory at 60% WFP supported maximum aerobic microbial activity as determined by CO2 production and O2 uptake. In the field, % WFP of surface no-tillage soils (0-75 mm) at four U.S. locations averaged 62% at time of sampling, whereas that for plowed soils was 44%. This difference in % WFP was reflected in 3.4 and 9.4 times greater CO2 and N2O production, respectively, from surface no-tillage soils over a 24-h period as compared to plowed soils. At a depth of 75 to 150 mm, % WFP values increased in both no-tillage and plowed soils, averaging approximately 70% for no tillage compared with 50 to 60% for plowed soils. Production of CO2 in the plowed soils was enhanced by the increased % WFP, resulting in little or no difference in CO2 production between tillage treatments. Nitrous oxide production, however, remained greater under no-tillage conditions. Substantially greater amounts of N2O were produced from the N-fertilized soils, regardless of tillage practice. Production of CO2 and N2O was primarily related to the % WFP of tillage treatments although, in several instances, soil-water-soluble C and NO-3 levels were important as well. Calculations of relative aerobic microbial activity between no-tillage and plowed soils, based on differences in % WFP relative to maximum activity at 60%, indicated linear relationships for CO2 and N2O production between WFP values of 30 to 70%. Below 60% WFP, water limits microbial activity, but above 60%, aerobic microbial activity decreases--apparently the result of reduced aeration.

  abstract = {Arable soils are a significant source of nitric oxide (NO), most of
       which is derived from nitrogen fertilizers. Accurate estimates
       of NO emissions from these soils are essential to devise
       strategies to mitigate the impact of agriculture on
       tropospheric ozone production and destruction. This paper
       presents the implementation of a soil NO emissions submodel
       within the environmentally-orientated soil-crop model, CERES-
       EGC. The submodel simulates NO production via the nitrification
       pathway, as modulated by soil environmental drivers. The
       resulting model was tested with data from 4 field experiments
       on wheat- and maize-cropped soils representative of two
       agricultural regions of France, over three years, and
       encompassing various climatic conditions. Overall, the model
       provided accurate predictions of NO emissions, but shortcomings
       arose from an inadequate vertical distribution of N fertilizer
       in the soil surface. Inclusion of a 2-cm thick topsoil layer in
       a 'micro-layer' version of CERES-EGC gave more realistic
       simulations of NO emissions and under-lying microbiological
       process. From a statistical point of view, both versions of the

       NH4+ fertilizer applied in the case of maize crops, and about
       1\% in the case of wheat crops. The 'micro-layer' version may be

  abstract = {The loss of ammonia by volatilization after slurry application may
       lead to large losses of soil-plant nitrogen. It is also a major
       source of atmospheric ammonia. These fluxes must therefore be
       accurately measured. However, volatilization depends on many
       features of the soil, climate and slurry, so that it is
       difficult to predict, or even to interpret and compare data
       from different experiments. We have developed a mechanistic
       model that simulates the influence of the various factors on
       volatilization, accounting for the transfers and equilibria in
       the topsoil and between the soil and the atmosphere. The model
       uses readily available input data, including soil,
       meteorological and slurry data. It includes energy balance and
       advection submodels, which make it suitable for field scale
       applications using simple meteorological data. Sensitivity
       analysis showed that soil pH has a large influence on
       volatilization. The model is also sensitive to soil adsorption
       capacity and some hydraulic characteristics (saturation water
       conductivity, water content at field capacity). It has been
       calibrated under real field conditions using experimental data
       for ammonia fluxes measured over two weeks after slurry
       application, with a micrometeorological method giving data at
       15-min intervals. The soil, climate and slurry factors were
       also measured. The model provides a fair picture of the ammonia
       fluxes throughout the volatilization, including the total
       ammonia volatilized, the decrease in daily loss and their
       short-term (< 1 h) variations due to the influence of
       meteorological conditions on soil surface temperature and
       atmospheric diffusion. Lastly the model has been used to
       simulate the influence of various meteorological conditions and
       agricultural techniques on ammonia volatilization. This model
       will make it easier to interpret data from different

       investigate the effect of management practices on the
       productivity or environmental impacts of arable crops. Ideally
       these models may claim to be universally applicable because
       they simulate the major processes governing the fate of inputs
       such as fertiliser nitrogen or pesticides. However, because
       they deal with complex systems and uncertain phenomena, site-
       specific calibration is usually a prerequisite to ensure their
       predictions are realistic. This statement implies that some
       experimental knowledge on the system to be simulated should be
       available prior to any modelling attempt, and raises a
       tremendous limitation to practical applications of models.
       Because the demand for more general simulation results is high,
       modellers have nevertheless taken the bold step of
       extrapolating a model tested within a limited sample of real
       conditions to a much larger domain. While methodological
       questions are often disregarded in this extrapolation process,
       they are specifically addressed in this paper, and in
       particular the issue of models a priori parameterisation. We
       thus implemented and tested a standard procedure to
       parameterize the soil components of a modified version of the
       CERES models. The procedure converts routinely-available soil
       properties into functional characteristics by means of pedo-
       transfer functions. The resulting predictions of soil water and
       nitrogen dynamics, as well as crop biomass, nitrogen content
       and leaf area index were compared to observations from trials
       conducted in five locations across Europe (southern Italy,
       northern Spain, northern France and northern Germany). In three
       cases, the model's performance was judged acceptable when
       compared to experimental errors on the measurements, based on a
       test of the model's root mean squared error (RMSE). Significant
       deviations between observations and model outputs were however
       noted in all sites, and could be ascribed to various model
       routines. In decreasing importance, these were: water balance,
       the turnover of soil organic matter, and crop N uptake. A
       better match to field observations could therefore be achieved
       by visually adjusting related parameters, such as field-
       capacity water content or the size of soil microbial biomass.
       As a result, model predictions fell within the measurement
       errors in all sites for most variables, and the model's RMSE
       was within the range of published values for similar tests. We
       conclude that the proposed a priori method yields acceptable
       simulations with only a 50\% probability, a figure which may be
       greatly increased through a posteriori calibration. Modellers
       should thus exercise caution when extrapolating their models to
       a large sample of pedo-climatic conditions for which they have
       only limited information.},

       composts (UWCs) requires a capacity to predict their effects on

       simulation models are expected to play a prominent role.
       However, the parameterization of soil organic amendments within
       such models generally requires laboratory incubation data.
       Here, we evaluated the benefit of using a biochemical index
       based on Van Soest organic matter fractions to parameterize a
       deterministic model of soil C and N dynamics, NCSOIL, as
       compared with a standard alternative based on laboratory
       incubation data. The data included C mineralization and
       inorganic N dynamics in samples of a silt loam soil (Typic
       Hapludalf) mixed with various types of UWC and farmyard manure.
       NCSOIL successfully predicted the various nitrogen
       mineralization-immobilization patterns observed, but
       underestimated CO, release by 10 to 30\% with the less stable
       amendments. The parameterization based on the biochemical index
       achieved a prediction error significantly larger than the
       standard parameterization in only 10\% of the tested cases, and
       provided an acceptable fit to experimental data. The
       decomposition rates and C to N ratios of compost organic matter
       varied chiefly according to the type of waste processed.
       However, 62 to 66\% of their variance could be explained by the
       biochemical index. We thus suggest using the latter to
       parameterize organic amendments in C and N models as a
       substitute for time-consuming laboratory incubations.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of biomass
       burning, and biological processes in soils. Biomass burning is
       not only an instantaneous source of nitrous oxide, but it
       results in a longer term enhancement of the biogenic production
       of this gas. Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions from soils
       before and after a controlled burn showed that significantly
       more nitrous oxide was exhaled after the burn. The current
       belief is that 90\% of the emissions come from soils. Nitrous
       oxide is formed in soils during the microbiological processes
       nitrification and denitrification. Because nitrous oxide is a
       gas it can escape from soil during these transformations.
       Nitrous oxide production is controlled by temperature, pH,
       water holding capacity of the soil, irrigation practices,
       fertilizer rate, tillage practice, soil type, oxygen
       concentration, availability of carbon, vegetation, land use
       practices and use of chemicals. Nitrous oxide emissions from
       agricultural soils are increased by the addition of fertilizer
       nitrogen and by the growth of legumes to fix atmospheric
       nitrogen. A recent analysis suggests that emissions of nitrous
       oxide from fertilized soils are not related to the type of
       fertilizer nitrogen applied and emissions can be calculated
       from the amount of nitrogen applied. Legumes also contribute to
       nitrous oxide emission in a number of ways, viz. atmospheric
       nitrogen fixed by legumes can be nitrified and denitrified in
       the same way as fertilizer nitrogen, thus providing a source of
       nitrous oxide, and symbiotically living Rhizobia in root
       nodules are able to denitrify and produce nitrous oxide.
       Conversion of tropical forests to crop production and pasture
       has a significant effect on the emission of nitrous oxide.
       Emissions of nitrous oxide increased by about a factor of two
       when a forest in central Brazil was clear cut, and pasture
       soils in the same area produced three times as much nitrous
       oxide as adjacent forest soils. Studies on temperate and
       tropical rice fields show that less than 0.1\% of the applied
       nitrogen is emitted as nitrous oxide if the soils are flooded
       for a number of days before fertilizer application. However, if
       mineral nitrogen is present in the soil before flooding it will
       serve as a source of nitrous oxide during wetting and drying
       cycles before permanent flooding. Thus dry seeded rice can be a
       source of considerable nitrous oxide. There are also indirect
       contributions to nitrous oxide emission through volatilization
       of ammonia and emission of nitric oxides into the atmosphere,
       and their redistribution over the landscape through wet and dry
       deposition. In general nitrous oxide emissions can be decreased
       by management practices which optimize the crop's natural
       ability to compete with processes whereby plant available
       nitrogen is lost from the soil-plant system. If these options
       were implemented they would also result in increased
       productivity and reduced inputs.},

       eastern Colorado, USA; two fertilizer treatments (urea and
       nitrate) on a fertilized grass ley cut for silage in Scotland;
       and two fertilized, cultivated crop fields in Germany where N2O
       loss during the winter was quite high. The models used were
       daily trace gas versions of the CENTURY model, DNDC, ExpertN,
       and the NASA-Ames version of the CASA model. These models
       included similar components (soil physics, decomposition, plant
       growth, and nitrogen transformations), but in some cases used
       very different algorithms for these processes. All models
       generated similar results for the general cycling of nitrogen
       through the agro-ecosystems, but simulated nitrogen trace gas
       fluxes were quite different. In most cases the simulated N2O
       fluxes were within a factor of about 2 of the observed annual
       fluxes, but even when models produced similar N2O fluxes they
       often produced very different estimates of gaseous N loss as

       Accurate simulation of soil moisture appears to be a key

       the observed effects of different fertilizer types on N2O flux.
       None of the models were able to reliably generate large pulses
       of N2O during brief winter thaws that were observed at the two

       the soil surface simulated by a Water and Nitrogen Management
       Model (WNMM), with three different gas modules, are compared to
       measurement data sets from two irrigated wheat-maize systems at
       two locations in the North China Plain (NCP) ( 2 years of
       measurement at the Luancheng site and 1 year of measurement at
       the Fengqiu site). The three gas modules are the WNMM gas
       module, the DAYCENT gas module, and the DNDC gas module. The
       term gas module used in this paper refers to the model
       component which simulates N2O emission from the processes of
       soil nitrification and denitrification. Soil water,
       temperature, organic matter decomposition, other nitrogen (N)
       transformations, such as mineralization and immobilization, and
       crop growth are simulated by the WNMM platform. For the 2-year
       data set from Luancheng, the three gas modules generate similar
       soil mineral N dynamics in the 0 - 20 cm topsoil. The daily
       time step, simply structured WNMM gas module consistently
       performs the best among the three gas modules for predicting
       soil denitrification fluxes (R-2 = 0.28, n = 39, p = 0.0006)
       and N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.45, n = 36, p < 0.0001). Up to 73,
       43, and 22\% of total N2O emissions are nitrification-induced as
       simulated by the DNDC, DAYCENT, and WNMM gas modules
       respectively, in this well-drained loam soil during the 2-year
       simulation. When applied to the 1-year data set at the Fengqiu
       site, the WNMM gas module consistently performs better in
       estimating N2O emissions (R-2 = 0.54, n = 35, p < 0.0001)
       compared to the other two modules. Simulations using the DNDC
       and DAYCENT gas modules explain over 40\% of the temporal
       variation of N2O emission from the soil. Further testing on
       different soils and different agroecosystems is needed to
       confirm the superior performance of the WNMM gas module

       concentration ([CO2]) has been the focus of international
       efforts, most apparent with the development of the Kyoto
       Protocol. Sequestration of carbon (C) in agricultural soils is
       being advocated as a method to assist in meeting the demands of
       an international C credit system. The conversion of
       conventionally tilled agricultural lands to no till is widely
       accepted as having a large-scale sequestration potential. In
       this study, C flux measurements over a no-till corn/soybean
       agricultural ecosystem over 6 years were coupled with estimates
       of C release associated with agricultural practices to assess
       the net biome productivity (NBP) of this no-till ecosystem.
       Estimates of NBP were also calculated for the conventionally
       tilled corn/soybean ecosystem assuming net ecosystem exchange
       is C neutral. These measurements were scaled to the US as a
       whole to determine the sequestration potential of corn/soybean
       ecosystems, under current practices where 10\% of agricultural
       land devoted to this ecosystem is no-tilled and under a
       hypothetical scenario where 100\% of the land is not tilled. The
       estimates of this analysis show that current corn/soybean
       agriculture in the US releases similar to 7.2 Tg C annually,
       with no-till sequestering similar to 2.2 Tg and conventional-
       till releasing similar to 9.4 Tg. The complete conversion of
       land area to no till might result in 21.7 Tg C sequestered
       annually, representing a net C flux difference of similar to 29
       Tg C. These results demonstrate that large-scale conversion to
       no-till practices, at least for the corn/soybean ecosystem,
       could potentially offset ca. 2\% of annual US carbon emissions.},

  abstract = {The possibility that the carbon sink in agricultural soils can be
       enhanced has taken on great political significance since the
       Kyoto Protocol was finalised in December 1997. The Kyoto
       Protocol allows carbon emissions to be offset by demonstrable
       removal of carbon from the atmosphere. Thus, forestry
       activities (Article 3.3) and changes in the use of agricultural
       soils (Article 3.4) that are shown to reduce atmospheric
       CO(2)levels may be included in the Kyoto emission reduction
       targets. The European Union is committed to a reduction in CO2
       emissions to 92\% of baseline (1990) levels during the first
       commitment period (2008-2012). We have shown recently that
       there are a number of agricultural land-management changes that
       show some potential to increase the carbon sink in agricultural
       soils and others that allow alternative forms of carbon
       mitigation (i.e. through fossil fuel substitution), but the
       options differ greatly in their potential for carbon
       mitigation. The changes examined were, (a) switching all animal
       manure use to arable land, (b) applying all sewage sludge to
       arable land, (c) incorporating all surplus cereal straw, (d)
       conversion to no-till agriculture, (e) use of surplus arable
       land to de-intensify 1/3 of current intensive crop production
       (through use of 1/3 grass/arable rotations), (f) use of surplus
       arable land to allow natural woodland regeneration, and (g) use
       of surplus arable land for bioenergy crop production. In this
       paper, we attempt for the first time to assess other (non-CO2)
       effects of these land-management changes on (a) the emission of
       the other important agricultural greenhouse gases, methane and
       nitrous oxide, and (b) other aspects of the ecology of the
       agroecosystems. We find that the relative importance of trace
       gas fluxes varies enormously among the scenarios. In some such
       as the sewage sludge, woodland regeneration and bioenergy
       production scenarios, the inclusion of trace gases makes only a
       small (< 10\%) difference to the CO2-C mitigation potential. In
       other cases, for example the no-till, animal manure and
       agricultural de-intensification scenarios, trace gases have a
       large impact, sometimes halving or more than doubling the CO2-C
       mitigation potential. The scenarios showing the greatest
       increase when including trace gases are those in which manure
       management changes significantly. In the one scenario (no-till)
       where the carbon mitigation potential was reduced greatly, a
       small increase in methane oxidation was outweighed by a sharp
       increase in N2O emissions. When these land-management options
       are combined to examine the whole agricultural land area of
       Europe, most of the changes in mitigation potential are small,
       but depending upon assumptions for the animal manure scenario,
       the total mitigation potential either increases by about 20\% or
       decreases by about 10\%, shifting the mitigation potential of
       the scenario from just above the EU's 8\% Kyoto emission
       reduction target (98.9 Tg C y(-1)) to just below it. Our
       results suggest that (a) trace gas fluxes may change the
       mitigation potential of a land management option significantly
       and should always be considered alongside CO2-C mitigation
       potentials and (b) agricultural management options show
       considerable potential for carbon mitigation even after
       accounting for trace gas fluxes.},

  abstract = {When appraising the impact of food and fiber production systems on the
       composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the 'greenhouse'
       effect, the entire suite of biogenic greenhouse gases - carbon
       dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) - needs
       to be considered. Storage of atmospheric CO2 into stable
       organic carbon pools in the soil can sequester CO2 while common
       crop production practices can produce CO2, generate N2O, and
       decrease the soil sink for atmospheric CH4. The overall balance
       between the net exchange of these gases constitutes the net
       global warming potential (GWP) of a crop production system.
       Trace gas flux and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage data from
       long-term studies, a rainfed site in Michigan that contrasts
       conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cropping, a rainfed
       site in northeastern Colorado that compares cropping systems in
       NT, and an irrigated site in Colorado that compares tillage and
       crop rotations, are used to estimate net GWP from crop
       production systems. Nitrous oxide emissions comprised 40-44\% of
       the GWP from both rain-fed sites and contributed 16-33\% of GWP
       in the irrigated system. The energy used for irrigation was the
       dominant GWP source in the irrigated system. Whether a system
       is a sink or source of CO2, i.e. net GWP, was controlled by the
       rate of SOC storage in all sites. SOC accumulation in the
       surface 7.5 cm of both rainfed continuous cropping systems was
       approximately 1100 kg CO2 equivalents ha(-1) y(-1). Carbon
       accrual rates were about three times higher in the irrigated
       system. The rainfed systems had been in NT for > 10 years while
       the irrigated system had been converted to NT 3 years before
       the start of this study. It remains to be seen if the C accrual
       rates decline with time in the irrigated system or if N2O
       emission rates decline or increase with time after conversion
       to NT.},

  abstract = {Production of milk causes environmental side effects, such as emission
       of greenhouse gases and nutrient enrichment in surface water.
       Scientific evidence that shows differences in integral
       environmental impact between milk production systems in the
       Netherlands was underexposed. In this paper, two Dutch milk
       production systems, i.e. a conventional and an organic, were
       compared on their integral environmental impact and hotspots
       were identified in the conventional and organic milk production
       chains. Identification of a hotspot provides insight into
       mitigation options for conventional and organic milk
       production. Data of commercial farms that participated in two
       pilot-studies were used and refer to the year 2003. For each
       farm, a detailed cradle-to-farm-gate life cycle assessment,
       including on and off farm pollution was performed. Results
       showed better environmental performance concerning energy use
       and eutrophication potential per kilogram of milk for organic
       farms than for conventional farms. Furthermore, higher on-farm
       acidification potential and global warming potential per
       kilogram organic milk implies that higher ammonia, methane, and
       nitrous oxide emissions occur on farm per kilogram organic milk
       than for conventional milk. Total acidification potential and
       global warming potential per kilogram milk did not differ
       between the selected conventional and organic farms. In
       addition, results showed lower land use per kilogram
       conventional milk compared with organic milk. In the selected
       conventional farms, purchased concentrates was found to be the
       hotspot in off farm and total impact for all impact categories,
       whereas in the selected organic farms, both purchased
       concentrates and roughage were found to be the hotspots in off

  abstract = {Different types of assessment tools have been developed in Europe with
       the purpose of determining the environmental impact of various
       livestock production systems at farm level. The assessment
       tools differ in terms of which environmental objectives are
       included and how indicators are constructed and interpreted.
       The paper compares typical tools for environmental assessment
       of livestock production systems, and recommends selected
       indicators suitable for benchmarking. The assessment tools used
       very different types of indicators ranging from descriptions of
       farm management and quantification of input to estimates of
       emissions of, e.g., nitrate and ammonia. The indicators should
       be useful in a benchmarking process where farmers may improve
       their practices through learning from farms with better agri-
       environmental performance. An example of this is given using
       data on P-surplus on pig farms. Some indicators used the area
       of the farm as the basis of the indicator-e.g. nitrogen surplus
       per hectare-while others were expressed per unit produced, e.g.
       emission of greenhouse gasses per kilogram milk. The paper
       demonstrates that a comparison of organic vs. conventional milk
       production and comparison of three pig production systems give
       different results, depending on the basis of the indicators
       (i.e. per hectare or per kilogram product). Indicators linked
       to environmental objectives with a local or regional
       geographical target should be area-based-while indicators with
       a global focus should be product-based. It is argued that the
       choice of indicators should be linked with the definition of
       the system boundaries, in the sense that area-based indicators
       should include emissions on the farm only, whereas product-
       based indicators should preferably include emissions from
       production of farm inputs, as well as the inputs on the actual
       farm. The paper ends with recommendations for choice of agri-
       environmental indicators taking into account the geographical
       scale, system boundary and method of interpretation. (c) 2005

  abstract = {Crop intensification is often thought to increase greenhouse gas (GHG)
       emissions, but studies in which crop management is optimized to
       exploit crop yield potential are rare. We conducted a field
       study in eastern Nebraska, USA to quantify GHG emissions,
       changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the net global warming
       potential (GWP) in four irrigated systems: continuous maize
       with recommended best management practices (CC-rec) or
       intensive management (CC-int) and maize-soybean rotation with
       recommended (CS-rec) or intensive management (CS-int). Grain
       yields of maize and soybean were generally within 80-100\% of
       the estimated site yield potential. Large soil surface carbon
       dioxide (CO2) fluxes were mostly associated with rapid crop
       growth, high temperature and high soil water content. Within
       each crop rotation, soil CO2 efflux under intensive management
       was not consistently higher than with recommended management.
       Owing to differences in residue inputs, SOC increased in the
       two continuous maize systems, but decreased in CS-rec or
       remained unchanged in CS-int. N2O emission peaks were mainly
       associated with high temperature and high soil water content
       resulting from rainfall or irrigation events, but less clearly
       related to soil NO3-N levels. N2O fluxes in intensively managed
       systems were only occasionally greater than those measured in
       the CC-rec and CS-rec systems. Fertilizer-induced N2O emissions
       ranged from 1.9\% to 3.5\% in 2003, from 0.8\% to 1.5\% in 2004 and
       from 0.4\% to 0.5\% in 2005, with no consistent differences among
       the four systems. All four cropping systems where net sources
       of GHG. However, due to increased soil C sequestration
       continuous maize systems had lower GWP than maize-soybean
       systems and intensive management did not cause a significant
       increase in GWP. Converting maize grain to ethanol in the two
       continuous maize systems resulted in a net reduction in life
       cycle GHG emissions of maize ethanol relative to petrol-based
       gasoline by 33-38\%. Our study provided evidence that net GHG
       emissions from agricultural systems can be kept low when
       management is optimized toward better exploitation of the yield
       potential. Major components for this included (i) choosing the
       right combination of adopted varieties, planting date and plant
       population to maximize crop biomass productivity, (ii) tactical
       water and nitrogen (N) management decisions that contributed to
       high N use efficiency and avoided extreme N2O emissions, and
       (iii) a deep tillage and residue management approach that
       favored the build-up of soil organic matter from large amounts
       of crop residues returned.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

       inference and prediction. Hierarchical Bayes (HB) represents a
       modelling structure with capacity to exploit diverse sources of
       information, to accommodate influences that are unknown (or
       unknowable), and to draw inference on large numbers of latent
       variables and parameters that describe complex relationships.
       Here I summarize the structure of HB and provide examples for
       common spatiotemporal problems. The flexible framework means
       that parameters, variables and latent variables can represent
       broader classes of model elements than are treated in
       traditional models. Inference and prediction depend on two
       types of stochasticity, including (1) uncertainty, which
       describes our knowledge of fixed quantities, it applies to all
       'unobservables' (latent variables and parameters), and it
       declines asymptotically with sample size, and (2) variability,
       which applies to fluctuations that are not explained by
       deterministic processes and does not decline asymptotically
       with sample size. Examples demonstrate how different sources of
       stochasticity impact inference and prediction and how allowance
       for stochastic influences can guide research.},

  abstract = {Process-based forest models generally have many parameters, multiple
       outputs of interest and a small underlying empirical database.
       These characteristics hamper parameterization. Bayesian
       calibration offers a solution to the calibration problem
       because it applies to models of any type or size. It provides
       parameter estimates, with measures of uncertainty and
       correlation among the parameters. The procedure begins by
       quantifying the uncertainty about parameter values in the form
       of a prior probability distribution. Then data on the output
       variables are used to update the parameter distribution by
       means of Bayes' Theorem. This yields a posterior calibrated
       distribution for the parameters, which can be summarized in the
       form of a mean vector and variance matrix. The predictive
       uncertainty of the model can be quantified by running it with
       different parameter settings, sampled from the posterior
       distribution. In a further step, one may evaluate the posterior
       probability of the model itself (rather than that of the
       parameters) and compare that against the probability of other
       models, to aid in model selection or improvement.},

       layer processes, the associated feedbacks and their regional
       scale impacts, are examined with particular emphasis on the
       central United States. Specifically, the role of contrasting
       forested and agricultural land covers in the initiation and
       subsequent evolution of summertime cloud patterns in the U.S.
       Midwest; and the impact of agricultural practices, including
       irrigation, on the surface climate of the U.S. High Plains are
       discussed in detail. Satellite-based observational results of
       previous work summarized in this paper indicate that the timing
       and intensity of cloud development appears to be influenced by
       both synoptic flow regimes and agricultural land use type. For
       example, under conditions characterized by high I pressure with
       surface winds generally less than 5 m s(-1), peak cloud
       development occurred almost two hours earlier over cropland
       than over the forest or boundary locations in Michigan. Cloud
       masses were also considerably taller over cropland in the mid-
       afternoon than over forest and land cover transition zones. The
       modeling results discussed here for a model domain centered
       over Nebraska indicate significant differences in the surface
       energy fluxes between the irrigated (control) and non-irrigated
       (dry) simulations. Surface latent heat flux was higher by 36\%
       and dewpoint temperature higher by 2.3 degrees C in the control
       simulation. Also, surface sensible heat flux of the control
       simulation was 15\% less and the near-ground (2 m) temperature
       was 1.2 degrees C less compared to dry run, indicating
       irrigation-induced surface cooling effect. Recent
       investigations on crop-climate interactions in which crop and
       ecological models were coupled to regional climate models show
       that incorporating important perturbations such as prolonged

       moisture budgets. Here we assess the importance of these
       biogeophysical effects for present-day climate, and quantify
       the radiative forcing of historical climate change by land use
       change for comparison with radiative forcings due to
       anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. We also
       discuss the implications of biogeophysical effects for the use
       of forestry as a tool for mitigating climate change through
       carbon sequestration. Our model results suggest that since most
       historical deforestation has taken place in temperate regions
       where the main climatic effect is an increase in surface
       albedo, the dominant biogeophysical effect of past land cover
       change has been a cooling. The northern mid-latitude
       agricultural regions are simulated to be approximately 1-2 K
       cooler in winter and spring in comparison with their previously
       forested state. This conflicts with the suggestion that land
       use change is responsible for the warming observed over the
       20th century. The increase in albedo by 1750 is simulated to
       exert a negative radiative forcing of approximately -2 W m(-2)
       locally over Europe, China and India, suggesting a potential
       anthropogenic influence on climate before fossil fuel burning
       began. The present-day global mean radiative forcing by
       anthropogenic surface albedo change relative to the natural
       state is simulated to be -0.2 W m(-2), which is comparable with
       the estimated forcings relative to pre-industrial times by
       stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, N2O, the halocarbons, and
       the direct effect of anthropogenic aerosols. In cold regions,
       afforestation or reforestation would decrease the surface
       albedo and induce a positive radiative forcing (warming) which
       could partly or completely offset the negative forcing
       (cooling) due to carbon sequestration. This suggests that
       carbon sink plantations could be less effective than expected
       at reducing warming, and could even cause further warming.
       However, we note that reforestation (or avoided deforestation)
       in tropical regions could exert a double cooling effect through
       carbon sequestration and increased evaporation and cloud cover.

       development of agriculture, land use change, the interactions
       between physiological properties of vegetation, ecosystem

       weather and climate, interactive mechanisms resulting from

       practices to reduce the impact of agriculture on the
       environment. It was demonstrated that important biophysical
       forcing with significant climate feedback exist as a result of
       agriculture-related land use change. It was concluded that
       biogeochemical forcing is usually considered but that
       biophysical impacts are not well characterized, and few studies
       have included both of these aspects. For example, human
       disturbances of the earth's surface that affect the energy
       budget might be as important climatologically as GHG emissions
       arising from land disturbance. It was suggested that current
       GHG mitigation practices should be reassessed to account for

       that there are significant opportunities and risks that occur
       in the complex interactions between agriculture and the

  abstract = {The Canadian Prairies have undergone important land use changes over
       the past 150 years. Beginning in the early 20th century, a
       significant portion of agricultural land was under
       surnmerfallow primarily to conserve soil moisture. The area
       under fallow grew to over 11 Mha, which constitute about 25\% of
       Canada's cultivated land, and mostly remained at that level
       until 1975, subsequent to which improved land management
       practices led to significant reductions in areas under
       summerfallow. By 2001 surnmerfallow area had been reduced to
       5.4 Mha, and future projections expect it to fall to 3.5 Mha.
       Numerous modeling studies and observations have shown that land
       use change can have a significant impact on regional and local
       climate. In the Canadian Prairies, these effects would likely
       be seen during the mid-June to mid-July period, when
       agricultural crops undergo rapid foliar expansion and
       substantial transpiration, thus contributing to significantly
       higher latent heat fluxes. Observations of 1976-2000 climate
       trends in the black, dark brown and brown soil zones of the
       Canadian Prairies showed that there have been substantial
       reductions in maximum temperature (1.7 degrees C decade(-1)),
       diurnal temperature range (1.1 degrees C decade(-1)) and solar
       radiation (1.2 MJ m(-2) decade(-1)), as well as a corresponding
       increase in precipitation (10.3 mm decade(-1)) during the mid-
       June to July period. These findings are in opposition to trends
       that would be expected from climate change from an enhanced
       greenhouse effect, and suggest that there is substantial
       correspondence between reductions in surnmerfallow and changes
       in climate in the agricultural regions of the Canadian
       Prairies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {One of the main options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation identified
       by the IPCC is the sequestration of carbon in soils. Since the
       breaking of agricultural land in most regions, the carbon
       stocks have been depleted to such an extent, that they now
       represent a potential sink for CO, removal from the atmosphere.
       Improved management will however, be required to increase the
       inputs of organic matter in the top soil and/or decrease
       decomposition rates. In this paper we use data from selected
       regions to explore the global potential for carbon
       sequestration in arable soils. While realising that C
       sequestration is not limited to the selected regions, we have,
       however, focussed our review on two regions: (i) Canadian
       Prairies and (ii) The Tropics. In temperate regions, management
       changes for an increase in C involve increase in cropping
       frequency (reducing bare fallow), increasing use of forages in
       crop rotations, reducing tillage intensity and frequency,
       better crop residue management, and adopting agroforestry. In
       the tropics, agroforestry remains the primary method by which
       sequestration rates may be significantly increased. Increases
       in soil C may be achieved through improved fertility of
       cropland/pasture; on extensive systems with shifting
       cultivation cropped fallows and cover crops may be beneficial,
       and adopting agro forestry or foresting marginal cropland is
       also an alternative. In addition, in the tropics it is
       imperative to reduce the clearing of forests for conversion to
       cropland. Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and
       sequestration potential have been performed, mainly for
       temperate industrialized North America where the majority of
       research pertaining to C sequestration has been carried out.
       More research is needed, especially for the Tropics, to more
       accurately capture the impact of region-specific interactions
       between climate, soil, and management of resources on C
       sequestration, which are lost in global level assessments. By
       itself, C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only
       modest contributions (3-6\% of fossil fuel contributions) to
       mitigation of overall greenhouse gas emissions. However,
       effective mitigation policies will not be based on any single
       'magic bullet' solutions, but rather on many modest reductions
       which are economically efficient and which confer additional
       benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is a
       significant mitigation option. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

       agricultural assessments of risk to climate change and
       variability and of other environmental risks should start with

  abstract = {Deserts are known to mankind, but the term desertification has always
       been an elusive concept. It is now defined in the United
       Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) as land
       degradation in the drylands (land failing within arid, semi-
       arid and dry sub-humid areas) resulting from various factors,
       including climatic variations and human activities. This
       definition, which is now being used worldwide to describe
       desertification and its impacts, leads to the need to consider
       carefully the two-way interactions between climate and
       desertification. Dramatic changes in agricultural practices
       during the last several decades are one of the main driving
       forces for land degradation in the drylands and examples of
       land degradation are given for several regions around the
       world. The effects of desertification on climate have been
       described mainly in terms of changes in land use and land cover
       leading to land degradation; overgrazing; biomass burning and
       atmospheric emissions; agriculture's contribution to air
       pollution; forest and woodland clearing and accelerated wind
       erosion; anthropogenic land disturbances and wind erosion; and
       the impact of irrigated agriculture on surface conditions in
       drylands. It is equally important to consider the impact of
       dryland climates on soils and vegetation and the impact of
       climate change on desertification. It is important to adopt
       uniform criteria and methods to assess desertification and
       encourage monitoring of dryland degradation in all the regions
       around the world. To better understand the interactions between
       climate and desertification, it is also important to identify
       the sources and sinks of dryland carbon, aerosols and trace
       gases in drylands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

       years), with reference to the last four ice age cycles. The
       industrial era, commonly regarded as commencing during the 18th
       century, is one noted when atmospheric greenhouse gas increases
       due to burning of fossil fuels and land use changes have been
       attributed to increases in global average near-surface
       temperatures, particularly in the latter part of the 20th
       century. However, analysis by Ruddiman has noted that in the
       Holocene during the period of civil society, the changes in
       atmospheric greenhouse gases have been anomalous compared with
       the geological record of the last 400,000 years. During this
       period, both carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) increased,
       probably as a result of the introduction of agrarian
       agriculture and land clearing in Eurasia. These, and other land
       use changes because of agrarian rural activities, may have
       caused a subtle forcing of climate, preventing climate cooling
       which might have been expected because of natural forcing. If
       future evidence supports the Ruddiman hypothesis, then
       agricultural and forestry activities during the period of civil
       society may have been exerting an influence on climate for, at

  abstract = {Albedo controls surface energy balance and affects the microclimate
       conditions of ecosystems. Changes in albedo could induce
       significant changes in climate. Anthropogenic and natural
       factors, such as land cover and land use change, could result
       in the albedo change of land surfaces. In this study, we used
       Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and climate
       station observations to investigate the albedo patterns of a
       temperate grassland (Grasslands National Park, Canada) and its
       changes due to the impact of climate variations. Our study
       focuses on 3 years of data (2001-2003), each of which had a
       different climatic regime. In 2001, precipitation fell well
       below its historical mean, and drought severely affected
       agricultural production over the GNP region. In 2002, annual
       precipitation was well above its historical mean, although most
       of the precipitation fell in the late growing season and
       drought conditions still occurred in the early growing season
       of the year. In 2003, annual precipitation was slightly lower
       than its historical mean, but more precipitation fell in the
       early growing season. MODIS and climate station observations
       suggest (a) during the winter-to-summer and summer-to-winter
       transitional periods, air temperature plays an important role
       in determining the surface albedo by controlling snow absence
       and presence; (b) in the winter season, the amount of
       precipitation (snow) greatly affects the surface albedo, of
       this ecosystem; (c) in the growing season, ecosystem water
       conditions can significantly alter the surface albedo of the
       semiarid grassland through their impact on plant growth and
       ecosystem conditions. These results show that surface albedo
       changes of this temperate grassland highly respond to climate
       variations. The results of this study have a number of
       implications in weather forecasting, climate change, and
       ecosystem studies. Our results stress the importance of (a)
       accurately simulating snow coverage fractions in regions where
       snow cover tends to exist throughout a long winter season, and
       thus, has a large influence on surface albedo; (b) accurately
       simulating temperatures during seasonal transitional periods (
       winter-summer or summer-winter) since they determine the dates
       that snow covers the land surface and, in turn, strongly impact
       on simulations of surface albedo; (c) explicitly linking the
       impacts of climate change with variations on surface albedo,
       and the feedbacks of the albedo response to the physical
       climate system, in the climate model projections. (c) 2006

       enrichment (FACE) technology have prompted comparisons between
       FACE experiments and 'enclosure studies' with respect to
       quantification of the effects of projected atmospheric CO2
       concentrations on crop yields. On the basis of one such
       comparison, it was argued that model projections of future food
       supply (some of which are based on older enclosure data) may
       have significantly overestimated the positive effect of
       elevated CO2 concentration on crop yields and, by extension,

       to differentiate 'enclosure study' methodologies with respect

       climatic changes (e.g. warming) that could impact crop yields.
       In this review, we demonstrate that relative yield stimulations
       in response to future CO2 concentrations obtained using a
       number of enclosure methodologies are quantitatively consistent
       with FACE results for three crops of global importance: rice

  abstract = {Bottom-up scaling of net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome
       production (NBP) was used to generate a carbon budget for a
       large heterogeneous region (the state of Oregon, 2.5 x 10(5)
       km(2)) in the western United States. Landsat resolution (30 m)
       remote sensing provided the basis for mapping land cover and
       disturbance history, thus allowing us to account for all major
       fire and logging events over the last 30 years. For NEP, a 23-
       year record (1980-2002) of distributed meteorology (1 km
       resolution) at the daily time step was used to drive a process-
       based carbon cycle model (Biome-BGC). For NBP, fire emissions
       were computed from remote sensing based estimates of area
       burned and our mapped biomass estimates. Our estimates for the
       contribution of logging and crop harvest removals to NBP were
       from the model simulations and were checked against public
       records of forest and crop harvesting. The predominately
       forested ecoregions within our study region had the highest NEP
       sinks, with ecoregion averages up to 197 gC m(-2)yr(-1).
       Agricultural ecoregions were also NEP sinks, reflecting the
       imbalance of NPP and decomposition of crop residues. For the
       period 1996-2000, mean NEP for the study area was 17.0 TgC
       yr(-1), with strong interannual variation (SD of 10.6). The sum
       of forest harvest removals, crop removals, and direct fire
       emissions amounted to 63\% of NEP, leaving a mean NBP of 6.1 TgC
       yr-(1). Carbon sequestration was predominantly on public
       forestland, where the harvest rate has fallen dramatically in
       the recent years. Comparison of simulation results with
       estimates of carbon stocks, and changes in carbon stocks, based
       on forest inventory data showed generally good agreement. The
       carbon sequestered as NBP, plus accumulation of forest products
       in slow turnover pools, offset 51\% of the annual emissions of
       fossil fuel CO2 for the state. State-level NBP dropped below
       zero in 2002 because of the combination of a dry climate year
       and a large (200 000 ha) fire. These results highlight the
       strong influence of land management and interannual variation
       in climate on the terrestrial carbon flux in the temperate
       zone.},

   help to mitigate GHG emissions through conservation measures. Impacts
   of agricultural practices and systems on GHG emission are reviewed and
   potential trade-offs among potential mitigation options are discussed.
   Conservation practices that help prevent soil erosion, may also
   sequester soil C and enhance CH4 consumption. Managing N to match crop
   needs can reduce N2O emission and avoid adverse impacts on water
   quality. Manipulating animal diet and manure management can reduce CH4

  abstract = {The carbon exchange of managed temperate grassland, previously
       converted from arable rotation, was quantified for two levels
       of management intensities over a period of 3 years. The
       original field on the Swiss Central Plateau had been separated
       into two plots of equal size, one plot was subjected to
       intensive management with nitrogen inputs of 200 kg ha(-1)
       year(-1) and frequent cutting, and the other to extensive
       management with no fertilization and less frequent cutting. For
       both plots, net CO2 exchange (NEE) was monitored by the eddy
       covariance technique. and the flux data were submitted to
       extensive quality control and gap filling procedures.
       Cumulative NEE was combined with values for carbon export
       through biomass harvests and carbon import through application
       of liquid manure (intensive field only) to yield the annual net
       carbon balance of the grassland ecosystems. The intensive
       management was associated with an average net carbon
       sequestration of 147 (+/- 130) g C m(-2) year(-1), whereas the
       extensive management caused a non-significant net carbon loss
       of 57 (+130/-110) g C m(-2) year(-1) Despite the large
       uncertainty ranges for the two individual systems, the special
       design of the paired experiment led to a reduced error of the
       differential effect, because very similar systematic errors for
       both parallel fields could be assumed. The mean difference in
       the carbon budget over the 3-year study period was determined
       to be significant with a value of 204 (+/- 110) g C m(-2)
       year(-1). The difference occurred in spite of similar
       aboveground productivities and root biomass. Additional
       measurements of soil respiration under standardized laboratory
       conditions indicated higher rates of soil organic carbon loss
       through mineralization under the extensive management. These
       data suggest that conversion of arable land to managed
       grassland has a positive effect on the carbon balance during
       the initial 3 years, but only if the system receives extra
       nitrogen inputs to avoid carbon losses through increased
       mineralization of soil organic matter. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

       crop. Additional measurements of biomass net primary production
       and leaf area index (LAI) were carried out. The response of the
       fluxes to climatic and non-climatic variables was analysed.
       Nighttime fluxes were dependent on turbulence, temperature and
       high soil water content. The u(*) correction was determined
       using a statistically based algorithm. The lower u(*) threshold
       was 0.1 m s(-1). Daytime fluxes during maximum canopy
       development depended mainly on incident radiation and its
       repartition between direct and diffuse components. A limited
       response to saturation deficit and soil water content was also
       observed. The evolution of assimilation and respiration
       throughout the growing season was studied. Maximum assimilation
       fluxes were observed in July when canopy had not fully
       developed and these then decreased from the end of July to the
       harvest, due not only to a reduction in radiation but also to a
       reduction in canopy assimilation capacity. Normalised
       respiration evolution presented two peaks during the year: the
       first in July, when the assimilation was at its greatest, and
       the second after the harvest, during the crop residues
       decomposition. The annual sequestration, estimated by half-

  abstract = {Eddy covariance was used to measure the net CO2 exchange (NEE) over
       ecosystems differing in land use (forest and agriculture) in
       Thuringia, Germany. Measurements were carried out at a managed,
       even-aged European beech stand (Fagus sylvatica, 70-150 years
       old), an unmanaged, uneven-aged mixed beech stand in a late
       stage of development (F. sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer
       pseudoplantanus, and other hardwood trees, 0-250 years old), a
       managed young Norway spruce stand (Picea abies, 50 years old),
       and an agricultural field growing winter wheat in 2001, and
       potato in 2002. Large contrasts were found in NEE rates between
       the land uses of the ecosystems. The managed and unmanaged
       beech sites had very similar net CO2 uptake rates (similar to-
       480 to -500 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Main differences in seasonal NEE
       patterns between the beech sites were because of a later leaf
       emergence and higher maximum leaf area index at the unmanaged
       beech site, probably as a result of the species mix at the
       site. In contrast, the spruce stand had a higher CO2 uptake in
       spring but substantially lower net CO2 uptake in summer than
       the beech stands. This resulted in a near neutral annual NEE
       (-4 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), mainly attributable to an ecosystem
       respiration rate almost twice as high as that of the beech
       stands, despite slightly lower temperatures, because of the
       higher elevation. Crops in the agricultural field had high CO2
       uptake rates, but growing season length was short compared with
       the forest ecosystems. Therefore, the agricultural land had
       low-to-moderate annual net CO2 uptake (-34 to -193 g C m(-2)),
       but with annual harvest taken into account it will be a source
       of CO2 (+97 to +386 g C m(-2)). The annually changing patchwork
       of crops will have strong consequences on the regions' seasonal
       and annual carbon exchange. Thus, not only land use, but also
       land-use history and site-specific management decisions affect
       the large-scale carbon balance.},

  abstract = {Carbon dioxide exchange was quantified in maize-soybean agroecosystems
       employing year-round tower eddy covariance flux systems and
       measurements of soil C stocks, CO2 fluxes from the soil
       surface, plant biomass, and litter decomposition. Measurements
       were made in three cropping systems: (a) irrigated continuous
       maize, (b) irrigated maize-soybean rotation, and (c) rainfed
       maize-soybean rotation during 2001-2004. Because of a variable
       cropping history, all three sites were uniformly tilled by
       disking prior to initiation of the study. Since then, all sites
       are under no-till, and crop and soil management follow best
       management practices prescribed for production-scale systems.
       Cumulative daily gain of C by the crops (from planting to
       physiological maturity), determined from the measured eddy
       covariance CO2 fluxes and estimated heterotrophic respiration,
       compared well with the measured total above and belowground
       biomass. Two contrasting features of maize and soybean CO2
       exchange are notable. The value of integrated GPP (gross
       primary productivity) for both irrigated and rainfed maize over
       the growing season was substantially larger (ca. 2:1 ratio)
       than that for soybean. Also, soybean lost a larger portion
       (0.80-0.85) of GPP as ecosystem respiration (due, in part, to
       the large amount of maize residue from the previous year), as
       compared to maize (0.55-0.65). Therefore, the seasonally
       integrated NEP (net ecosystem production) in maize was larger
       by a 4:1 ratio (approximately), as compared to soybean.
       Enhanced soil moisture conditions in the irrigated maize and
       soybean fields caused an increase in ecosystem respiration,
       thus eliminating any advantage of increased GPP and giving
       about the same values for the growing season NEP as the tainted
       fields. On an annual basis, the NEP of irrigated continuous
       maize was 517, 424, and 381 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively,
       during the 3 years of our study. In tainted maize the annual
       NEP was 510 and 397 g C m(-2) year(-1) in years I and 3,
       respectively. The annual NEP in the irrigated and tainted
       soybean fields were in the range of -18 to -48 g C m(-2).
       Accounting for the grain C removed during harvest and the CO2
       released from irrigation water, our tower eddy covariance flux
       data over the first 3 years suggest that, at this time: (a) the
       rainfed maize-soybean rotation system is C neutral, (b) the
       irrigated continuous maize is nearly C neutral or a slight
       source of C, and (c) the irrigated maize-soybean rotation is a
       moderate source of C. Direct measurement of soil C stocks could
       not detect a statistically significant change in soil organic
       carbon during the first 3 years of no-till farming in these
       three cropping systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

abstract = {Estimates of agricultural C sequestration require an understanding of how net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and net biome productivity (NBP) are affected by land use. Such estimates will most likely be made using mathematical models that have undergone well-constrained tests against field measurements of CO2 exchange as affected by management. We tested a hydraulically driven soil-plant-atmosphere C and water transfer scheme in ecosys against CO2 and energy exchange measured by eddy covariance (EC) over irrigated and rainfed no-till maize-soybean rotations at Mead, NE. Correlations between modeled and measured fluxes (R2 > 0.8) indicated that <20% of variation in EC fluxes could not be explained by the model. Annual aggregations of modeled fluxes indicated that NEP of irrigated and rainfed soybean in 2002 was -30 and -9 g C m-2 yr-1 (net C source) while NEP of irrigated and rainfed maize in 2003 was 615 and 397 g C m-2 yr-1 (net C sink). These NEPs were within the range of uncertainty in annual NEP estimated from gap-filled EC fluxes. When grain harvests were subtracted from NEP to calculate NBP, both the modeled and measured maize-soybean rotations became net C sources of 40 to 80 g C m-2 yr-1 during 2002 and 2003. Long-term model runs (100 yr) under repeated 2001-2004 weather sequences indicated that a rainfed no-till maize-soybean rotation at Mead would lose about 30 g C m-2 yr-1. Irrigating this rotation would raise SOC by an average of 6 g C m-2 yr-1 over rainfed values. Modeled and measured results indicated only limited opportunity for long-term soil C storage in irrigated or rainfed maize-soybean rotations under the soil, climate, and management typical of intensive crop production in the U.S. Midwest.

  abstract = {We developed a biogeophysical model called Agro-C to assess the
       regional carbon budgets of agroecosystems on a large scale. The
       model consists of two submodels, Crop-C and Soil-C. Crop-C
       simulates crop photosynthesis, autotrophic respiration and net
       primary production (NPP). Soil-C simulates soil heterotrophic
       respiration via the decomposition of both input organic carbon
       and soil organic carbon (SOC). Changes in SOC are determined by
       balancing the loss of soil carbon with the sequestration of
       input organic carbon. The model also simulates the net
       ecosystem exchange (NEE) between cropland and the atmosphere.
       Agro-C was validated against independent datasets from the
       literature, multi-year agricultural statistics, and field
       measurements in China. These datasets covered areas with a
       range of climates, soils, crop rotations and agricultural
       practices. Model validation showed that Crop-C simulated NPP
       quite well for rice, wheat and maize, and reasonably well for
       cotton, while it did not simulate NPP well for soybean and
       rapeseed. Changes in SOC at different sites could be properly
       simulated, although there was a systematic negative bias.
       Observed seasonal fluctuations of NEE in a winter wheat-maize
       rotation system were well captured by Agro-C, but a discrepancy
       existed at a daily timescale. These systematic biases and
       errors may result from imperfect inputs, insufficient knowledge
       and inappropriate simplifications during model development. We
       conclude that the Agro-C can simulate crop NPP and changes in
       SOC under various conditions of climate, soil, and agricultural
       practices in general, making it possible to extrapolate the
       model to a wider domain. Agro-C also has the potential for
       modeling net CO2 exchange between cropland and the atmosphere.
       Further improvements of Agro-C should focus on the enhancement
       of its descriptive power for key processes, as well as on
       parameterization, re-calibration and validation using
       spatiotemporal datasets across a wider domain so that it can be
       more applicable to broader regions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract = {We assessed the effects of rising atmospheric CO2, changing climate,
       and farmers' practice on the carbon and water balance of
       European croplands during the past century (1901-2000). The
       coupled vegetation-crop model ORCHIDEE-STICS is applied over
       western Europe for C3 crops (winter wheat) and for maize, with
       prescribed historical agricultural practice changes. Not
       surprisingly, the enormous crop yield increase observed in all
       European regions, 300-400\% between 1950 and 2000, is found to
       be dominantly explained by improved practice and varieties
       selection, rather than by rising CO2 (explaining a similar to
       11\% uniform increase in yield) and changing climate (no further
       change in yield on average, but causing a decrease of similar
       to 19\% in the southern Iberian Peninsula). Agricultural soil
       carbon stocks in Europe are modeled to have decreased between
       1950 and 1970, and since then to have increased again. Thus,
       the current stocks only differ by 1 +/- 6 tC ha(-1) from their
       1900 value. Compensating effects of increasing yields on the
       one hand (increasing stocks) and of higher harvest index values
       and ploughing on the other hand (decreasing stocks) occur. Each
       of these processes taken individually has the potential to
       strongly alter the croplands soil carbon balance in the model.
       Consequently, large uncertainties are associated to the
       estimated change in carbon stocks between 1901 and 2001,
       roughly +/- 6 tC ha(-1) a(-1). In our most realistic
       simulation, the current cropland carbon balance is a net sink
       of 0.16 +/- 0.15 tC ha(-1) a(-1). The annual water balance of
       cropland soils is influenced by increasing crop water use
       efficiency, one third of which is caused by rising CO2.
       However, increasing water use efficiency occurred mainly in
       spring and winter, when water is not limiting for plant growth,
       whereas no strong savings of soil water are achieved in summer
       through elevated CO2. Overall, trends in cultivation practices
       have caused a 3 times larger increase of water use efficiency
       than rising CO2.},

       (CO2) in the soil-vegetation -atmosphere system is important
       for assessing the role of the terrestrial ecosystem in the
       global water and carbon cycle and in climate change. We present
       a soil- vegetation -atmosphere integrated model (ChinaAgrosys)
       for simulating energy, water and CO, fluxes, crop growth and
       development, with ample supply of nutrients and in the absence
       of pests, diseases and weed damage. Furthermore, we test the
       hypotheses of whether there is any significant difference
       between simulations over different time steps. CO2, 41 water
       and heat fluxes were estimated by the improving
       parameterization method of the coupled photosynthesis- stomatal
       conductance -transpiration model. Soil water evaporation and
       plant transpiration were calculated using a multilayer water
       and heat-transfer model. Field experiments were conducted in
       the Yucheng Integrated Agricultural Experimental Station on the
       North China Plain. Daily weather and crop growth variables were
       observed during 1998-2001, and hourly weather variables and
       water and heat fluxes were measured using the eddy covariance
       method during 2002-2003. The results showed that the model
       could effectively simulate diurnal and seasonal changes of net
       radiation, sensible and latent heat flux, soil heat flux and
       CO2 fluxes. The processes of evapotranspiration, soil
       temperature and leaf area index agree well with the measured
       values. Midday depression of canopy photosynthesis could be
       simulated by assessing the diurnal change in canopy water
       potential. Moreover, the comparisons of simulated daily
       evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) under
       different time steps indicated that time steps used by a model
       affect the simulated results. There is no significant
       difference between simulated evapotranspiration using the model
       under different time steps. However, simulated NEE produces
       large differences in the response to different time steps.
       Therefore, the accurate calculation of average absorbed
       photosynthetic active radiation is important for the scaling of
       the model from hourly steps to daily steps in simulating energy
       and CO, flux exchanges between winter wheat and the atmosphere.

  abstract = {A forest ecosystem model (CASTANEA) is developed with the aim to
       bridge the gap between soil-vegetation-atmosphere (SVAT) and
       growth models. A physiologically multi-layer process-based
       model is built, completed with a carbon allocation model and
       coupled with a soil model. CASTANEA describes canopy
       photosynthesis and transpiration, maintenance and growth
       respiration, seasonal development, partitioning of assimilates
       to leaves, stems, branches, coarse and fine roots,
       evapotranspiration, soil heterotrophic respiration, water and
       carbon balances of the soil. Net primary productivity (NPP) is
       calculated as the difference between gross photosynthesis and
       plant respiration. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) between
       soil-plant system and atmosphere is calculated as the
       difference between gross photosynthesis and total respiration
       (soil + plants). The meteorological driving variables are
       global radiation, rainfall, wind speed, air humidity and
       temperature (either half-hourly or daily values). A complete
       description of the model parameterization is given for an eddy
       flux station in a beech stand (Hesse, France). A parametric
       sensitivity analysis is carried out to get a classification of
       the model parameters according to their effect on the NEE. To
       determine the key input parameters, a +10\% or -10\% bias is
       applied on each of the 150 parameters in order to estimate the
       effect on simulated NEE. Finally 17 parameters, linked to
       photosynthesis, vegetative respiration and soil water balance,
       appear to have a significant effect (more than 2.5\%) on the
       NEE. An uncertainty analysis is then presented to evaluate the
       error on the annual and daily NEE outputs caused by
       uncertainties in these input parameters. Uncertainties on these
       parameters are estimated using data collected in situ. These
       uncertainties are used to create a set of 17,000 simulations,
       where the values of the 17 key parameters are randomly selected
       using gaussian random distributions. A mean uncertainty of 30\%
       on the annual NEE is obtained. This uncertainty on the
       simulated daily NEE does not totally explain the discrepancies
       with the daily NEE measured by the eddy covariance technique
       (EC). Errors on daily measurements by EC technique and

       land-surface models which are coupled to climate models, while
       the area it occupies will significantly increase in the next
       century according to future scenarios. In order to improve the
       representation of croplands in a Dynamic Global Vegetation
       Model named ORCHIDEE (which can be coupled to the IPSL1 climate
       model), we have (1) developed a procedure which assimilates
       some of the variables simulated by a detailed crop model,
       STICS, and (2) modified some parameterisations to avoid
       inconsistencies between assimilated and computed variables in
       ORCHIDEE. Site simulations show that the seasonality of the
       cropland-atmosphere fluxes of water, energy and CO2 is strongly
       modified when more realistic crop parameterisations are
       introduced in ORCHIDEE. A more realistic representation of
       wheat and corn croplands over Western Europe leads to a drying
       out of the atmosphere at the end of summer and during autumn,
       while the soils remain wetter, specially at the time when
       winter crops are sowed. The seasonality of net CO2 uptake
       fluxes is also enhanced and shortened.},

       the model can provide RUE for net carbon accumulation and

       accumulation and gross photosynthesis) for a range of incident

       recognizing that (a) these crops are grown in substantially
       different environmental conditions than those for wheat, and
       (b) while rice is a C-3 crop like wheat, maize and sorghum are
       C-4 crops. The calculated RUE values for net carbon
       accumulation differed from observations (five for maize, two
       for sorghum and three for rice) by -24\% to +19\%, with an
       average (n = 10) of -4\% (underestimation), while the calculated

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of crop growth and radiation use efficiency (RUE)
       under optimal growth conditions is required to predict plant
       dry matter accumulation and grain yield near the genetic growth
       potential. Research was conducted to quantify the biomass and
       leaf area index (LAI) accumulation, extinction coefficient, and
       RUE of maize (Zea mays L.) under conditions of optimal growth.
       Maize was grown in two environments over five growing seasons (
       1998-2002). Total aboveground biomass at maturity ranged from
       2257 g M-2 in 1998 to 2916 g m(-2) in 2001; values that are
       considerably greater than the biomass achieved in most previous
       studies on RUE in maize. Peak LAI ranged from 4.8 to 7.8. Maize
       extinction coefficients during vegetative growth (k) were
       within the range of recently published values (0.49 +/- 0.03),
       with no clear pattern of differences in k among years. Seasonal
       changes in interception of photosynthetically active radiation
       (PAR) were similar across all but one year. Estimates of RUE
       were obtained using the short-interval crop growth rate method
       and the cumulative biomass and absorbed PAR (APAR) method.
       Values of RUE obtained using the two methods were 3.74
       (+/-0.20) g MJ(-1) APAR and 3.84 (+/-0.08) g MJ(-1)APAR,
       respectively, and did not vary among years. This compares to a
       published mean RUE for maize of 3.3 g MJ(-1) of intercepted PAR
       (Mitchell et al., 1998). Moreover, RUE did not decline during
       grain filling. Differences in biomass accumulation among years
       were attributed in part to differences in observed radiation
       interception, which varied primarily due to differences in LAI.
       Maize simulation models that rely on RUE for biomass
       accumulation should use an RUE of 3.8 g MJ(-1) APAR for
       predicting optimum yields without growth limitations.},

       examine the effects of elevated [CO2] on canopy radiation- and

       Mammoth) were grown at ambient (399 mu mol mol(-1)) and

       Whole canopy carbon- and water-fluxes were measured
       continuously during the period of the experiment. The results
       indicated that elevated [CO2] enhanced daily total canopy
       carbon- and water-fluxes by 53\% and 11\%, respectively, on a
       ground-area basis, resulting in a 54\% increase in radiation-use
       efficiency (RUE) based on intercepted photosynthetic active
       radiation and a 26\% increase in water-use efficiency (WUE) by
       the end of the experiment. Canopy carbon- and water-fluxes at
       both CO2 treatments varied with canopy development. They were
       small at 22 days after planting (DAP) and gradually increased
       to the maxima at 46 DAP. When canopy carbon- and water-fluxes
       were expressed on a leaf-area basis, no effect of CO2 was found

       canopy carbon-flux by 29\%, on average. Night-time canopy

  abstract = {Because of its large N fertiliser requirements and long growth cycle,
       winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is considered to expose
       its environment to substantial risks of N losses. Soil-crop
       models provide unique tools to analyse such impacts, with an
       accuracy that primarily relies on the simulation of crop C and
       N budgets. Here, we describe a model simulating the growth and
       development of oilseed rape that was adapted from CERES-N Maize
       and a previously existing rape model. In addition to its soil
       components, the model, called CERES-Rape, has modules for crop
       phenology, net photosynthesis, leaf area development and grain
       filling, as influenced by crop N status. A new feature compared
       to previous rape models is the ability to predict the crop's C
       and N budgets throughout its growth cycle, including losses
       from leaves by senescence. It also contains a mechanistic
       description of N translocation from vegetative parts to pods
       and grains after the onset of flowering. The model has been
       calibrated on a one-year experiment with three fertiliser N
       levels conducted in France, and subsequently tested on a
       similar experiment from Denmark for which no parameters were
       adjusted. In the vegetative phase, the time course of biomass
       and N accumulations in the various plant compartments was well
       simulated, with predicted values falling within one or two
       standard deviations from the mean in the measurements, except
       for the low-N treatments for which the high rates of leaf
       senescence could not be mimicked. After the onset of flowering,
       some bias appeared in the simulation of crop N uptake which
       impaired the predictions of final grain N yields. Simulated
       grain dry matter yields matched observations within +/-15\% for
       the calibration data set, but were over-estimated by a factor
       of 2 for the other data set. Despite the above shortcomings,
       the simulation of fertiliser effects on the dynamics of crop N
       uptake and dry matter was judged sufficiently satisfactory to
       allow an investigation of N losses from rapeseed-cropped soils
       with the CERES-Rape model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {In temperate environments, the total dry matter (TDM) of a crop is
       closely related to the amount of photosynthetically active
       radiation absorbed (Sigma PARa), as long as other factors
       (water, nutrients,...) are non-limiting. For oilseed rape
       crops, many authors have shown that the radiation use
       efficiency (RUEa) varies within a wide range, from 1 to 4 g
       MJ(-1) of Sigma PARa according to developmental stage and
       environmental conditions. In order to explain this variability,
       effects of N and temperature on RUEa were investigated during a
       1-year field experiment involving three N treatments (N
       fertilisation rates: 0, 135 and 270 kg ha(-1)). Leaf, flower,
       and pod surface areas, as well as the DM and N content of the
       various plant parts were measured every 2-4 weeks for 17
       sampling dates from emergence to harvest. RUEa was calculated
       from total generated DM (shoot and root DM, plus that of dead
       leaves fallen to the ground). Daily PARa was calculated using a
       3-layer model laking into account leaf and pod absorption and
       reflection of PAR by flowers and soil. The N nutrition index
       (NNI) proposed by Lemaire and Gastal (1997) was used to
       evaluate the N effect on RUEa. NNI was significantly higher
       than the critical N value (meaning that N was non-limiting) for
       the N270 treatment from emergence to pod formation, but N
       deficiency occurred with NO at the 12-leaf stage and later with
       N135 at flowering. The maximum possible RUEa (RUEa(max)) was
       assumed to be the value obtained with the treatment N270, where
       N was non-limiting. The N deficiencies which occurred for NO
       and N135 significantly reduced the green LAI and PAI, and
       consequently Sigma PARa. To remove any effect other than N on
       the RUEa, the ratio of actual to maximum RUEa (RUEa/RUEa(max))
       proposed by Belanger et al. (1992) was calculated for each
       developmental stage of oilseed rape. A linear regression fit
       well (R-2=0.919; 8 d.f.) the response of RUEa/RUEa(max) versus
       N deficiency, for values of NNI lower than 1. The resulting
       equation was the following: RUEa/RUEa(max) = 0.74 x NNI + 0.23.
       RUEa(max) was also significantly affected by developmental
       stage. Whereas the corresponding changes in RUEa(max) from the
       6-leaf stage to the end of flowering could be related to air
       temperature, there was evidence of a developmental effect in
       the other stages. RUEa was lower in the early stages (emergence
       to 5-6 leaves), and from pod formation until ripening; the
       latter decrease could be attributed to the high energy cost of
       lipid biosynthesis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

  abstract = {Crop simulation models are important tools for agronomic management
       strategy evaluation, particularly under rainfed conditions.
       This paper describes the structure and testing of OILCROP-SUN,
       a process-oriented model of the sunflower (Helianthus annuus
       L.) crop. The model simulates organ biomass and N content, leaf
       area index, and soil water and N balances with a daily time
       step. Daily weather data, soil physical and chemical
       characteristics, and initial contents of water and N are
       required inputs. Three cultivar-specific parameters synthesize
       crop responses to temperature and photoperiod during
       development, and two cultivar-specific parameters define
       potential grain number per capitulum and potential kernel
       growth rate, Tested against independent data sets, the model
       generated good predictions of the durations of the sowing-
       emergence (range 7 to 32 d; root mean square error [RMSE],
       observed vs. simulated: 3.7 d) and emergence-anthesis phases
       (range 52 to 146 d; RMSE between 2.9 and 4.3 d, depending on
       the cultivar). The model also simulated seasonal crop biomass
       and leaf area dynamics for irrigated and rainfed crops sown at
       two densities satisfactorily, as well as aerial biomass (range
       5 to 15 t ha(-1); RMSE 1.7 t ha(-1)) and grain yield at
       maturity (range 1.0 to 6.2 t ha(-1); RMSE 0.8 t ha(-1)) for
       irrigated and rainfed crops sown at a range of population
       densities (0.5 to 10 plants m(-2)). We conclude that OILCROP-
       SUN can be used to simulate biomass and grain yields over a
       wide range of conditions.},

  abstract = {Radiation use efficiency (e) is a crop parameter widely used in crop
       simulation models, derived here as the slope of the
       relationship linking crop carbon gain to cumulative intercepted
       solar radiation. Our objectives were to: (i) determine e of
       field-grown sunflower, sorghum, wheat and chickpea, at three
       levels of aggregation-day-time net assimilation (A), daily net
       carbon gain as difference between A and night-time dark
       respiration (R) and biomass; (ii) assess the robustness of
       epsilon parameter in terms of ability to discriminate between
       C-3 and C-4 species, pre- and post-anthesis and impact of
       nitrogen status; (iii) evaluate the opportunity to normalize e
       for climate. Field experiments were conducted in 1998 and 1999
       in southern Italy. All crops were well watered. Sunflower and
       sorghum had two nitrogen application treatments, wheat only one
       and chickpea had no added nitrogen. Daily intercepted solar
       radiation was derived from measurements of daily incident solar
       radiation and the percentage of mid-day light interception.
       Closed-system canopy chambers monitored canopy gas-exchange
       rates. e, expressed in terms of A, A - R or above-ground
       biomass, was linear over the entire growth cycle of sorghum and
       wheat, and up to anthesis in sunflower and chickpea,
       independent of temperature, vapour pressure deficit and
       radiation regimes. In sunflower, deviation from linearity was
       observed after anthesis, due to higher carbon cost in yielding
       oil seeds. No conclusions could be drawn for post-anthesis
       chickpea due to the interruption of the experiment caused by a
       thunderstorm. Overall results showed a great variability in
       epsilon: values, independently of classes of species (C-4 and
       C-3), crops and nitrogen treatments. This indicates that the
       robustness of e to predict biomass productivity in crop
       simulation models is constrained. Attempts to normalize epsilon
       by vapour pressure deficit (D), for reducing its variability
       due to climate and overlaps between crops failed. (c) 2005

       residue fractions on mineralisation-immobilisation turnover was
       evaluated. Heterogeneous organic substrates were represented in
       the model by three Van Soest pools, decomposing at different
       rates. Dried and ground wheat straw, sunflower stalks, wheat
       stubble and sheep manure (5.22 g kg(-1) soil) were respectively
       added to a Chromic Calcixerert and aerobically incubated for
       224 days at 22 +/- 2 degrees C and 75\% field capacity. The CO2
       evolution rates peaked shortly after the C amendments were
       added, with the highest rate in the sunflower- stalk-amended
       soils. The addition of organic substrates induced rapid N
       immobilisation. Net mineralisation was detected earliest in the
       sunflower-stalk treatment (day 14), while soils with the other
       amendments showed no net N mineralisation until day 52. The
       NCSOIL model was calibrated for this soil with CO2 and
       inorganic N data from the control soil, yielding a chi(2) value
       of 0.011. The overestimation by the model of the C
       mineralisation data in the case of C-amended soils clearly
       showed that the concept of three Van Soest pools, decomposing
       independently at a specific rate constant, is not valid. A
       retardation factor, that was related to the lignin content of
       the decomposing material, was introduced into the model. After
       its introduction the model satisfactorily simulated the C
       mineralisation rates. However, for all plant residues, N
       mineralisation was underestimated towards the end of the
       incubation period. In the case of the soil amended with sheep
       manure, there was a large discrepancy between simulated and
       experimental N mineralisation-immobilisation kinetics,
       suggesting a different allocation of N in animal manure to
       N-containing fractions compared to that of plant residues. The
       results indicated that a N fractionation procedure for organic
       residues should be tested and incorporated into the model.},

       availability (0.5, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.9\% N of straw dry matter) in
       a microcosm experiment at controlled temperature (15 degrees C)
       and moisture (-10 kPa), (2) to elucidate underlying mechanisms
       at the microbial-community level, and (3) to develop a model
       according to the measurements. Concentrations of available N
       (straw N and soil inorganic N) below 1.2\% of straw dry matter
       significantly reduced the rate of carbon mineralization from
       straw residues and the growth of total soil microbial biomass
       (chloroform fumigation-extraction). The negative effects
       appeared shortly after the pool of soil mineral N had been
       depleted. The N effect on the microbial community was mainly
       caused by reduced fungal growth (ergosterol), while total
       bacterial biomass (epifluorescence microscopy) was not
       significantly affected. However, number of cellulase-producing,
       colony-forming bacterial units decreased with decreasing N
       availability. In straw-amended soil, decreasing N
       concentrations reduced activities of exocellulase,
       endocellulase and hemicellulase, while in unamended control
       soil the effects were opposite. We developed a model in which
       three fractions of straw residues, determined by proximate
       analysis (Van Soest), and a humus pool were assumed to decay
       according to first-order rate kinetics. In accordance with the
       microbial measurements, the microbial community was subdivided
       into three groups consuming readily decomposable, structural
       and humus materials respectively. When holocellulose decay rate
       was modified as a function of N availability, the model
       simulated N effects on C mineralization and microbial biomass
       growth very well. Our experiment showed that wheat straw
       mineralization may be retarded at N concentrations well above
       those frequently found after grain harvest in the field and
       that effects of N availability should be taken into account
       when modelling C and N turnover in agricultural soils.
       Moreover, the trial exemplified a situation where studies of
       functional groups of decomposer organisms were required to
       explain and model satisfactorily differences observed at the
       process level. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

       Dried wheat shoots (2 g C kg-1) with a C/N ratio of 14.4, or
       cellulose with ((NH4)2SO4)-N-15) at the same C rate and C/N

       degrees-C and 60\% water-holding capacity. Inorganic and
       Kjeldahl N and N-15 were measured and compared with simulated
       data. Cellulose induced net immobilization of 70 mg N kg-1
       within 2 wk; thereafter, net N mineralization was greater than
       for untreated soils. The decomposition rate constant of
       cellulose, computed by optimization of the model, was 0.024

       rate of net N mineralization, and the isotopic dilution of

  abstract = {Many ecosystem models have been developed for simulating water and
       carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and terrestrial
       ecosystems. One, the biogeochemical cycles (BIOME-BGC) model,
       simulates the storage and fluxes of water, carbon and nitrogen
       within the vegetation, litter and soil components of a
       terrestrial ecosystem. The model permits sophisticated
       simulations of natural ecosystems such as forest, grassland and
       shrub-land. However, it has rarely been applied to agricultural
       ecosystems. This study was conducted for exploring the ability
       of the BIOME-BGC for crops in China. For this propose, we set
       up an eddy-covariance tower in the North China Plain in 2002
       and have obtained both flux data and related data of
       meteorological, vegetation and soil properties. By using these
       observation data, we modified eco-physiological parameters in
       the model. Correspondence between the simulated results with
       observations suggested that the modified model can be used to
       predict crop growth as well as water (H2O) and carbon (CO2)
       fluxes under the consideration of the effects of anthropogenic
       forcing. To estimate the effects of anthropogenic forcing, we
       executed the model simulation under two scenarios: undisturbed
       and disturbed. The undisturbed scenario aimed to simulate
       potential plant growth and functioning with natural levels of
       atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen deposition, but the effects of
       anthropogenic forcing were simulated in the disturbed scenario.
       Results showed that the simulated H2O and CO2 fluxes are higher
       in the disturbed scenario than those in the undisturbed
       scenario, which suggests that anthropogenic forcing had an
       apparent effect on the water and carbon fluxes and
       sequestration capacity. However, simulation also indicated that
       nitrogen application from chemical fertiliser is greater than
       the requirements of crops, which might cause water and soil
       pollution in the study area. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

       Carlo methods, for example for the Metropolis-Hastings
       algorithm, is well known to be a crucial factor for the

       adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm, where the Gaussian proposal
       distribution is updated along the process using the full
       information cumulated so far. Due to the adaptive nature of the
       process, the AM algorithm is non-Markovian, but we establish
       here that it has the correct ergodic properties. We also
       include the results of our numerical tests, which indicate that
       the AM algorithm competes well with traditional Metropolis-
       Hastings algorithms, and demonstrate that the AM algorithm is
       easy to use in practical computation.},

  abstract = {Within an agricultural landscape of western Denmark, the carbon
       dioxide exchange was studied throughout a year (April 1998-
       March 1999). During the growing season, five eddy correlation
       systems were operated in parallel over some of the more
       important crops (winter wheat, winter barley, spring barley,
       maize and grass). A sixth system was mounted on top of a 48 m
       mast to enable landscape-wide flux measurements both in summer
       and winter. The spatial distribution of the different crop
       types was mapped by use of satellite images (Landsat TM and
       SPOT). A very large diversity in carbon functioning is observed
       when comparing the carbon dioxide fluxes from the different
       fields. In the middle of the growing season, May-June, the
       daytime CO2 fluxes range from a net emission of 5 g C m(-2) per
       day to a carbon assimilation of 12 g C m(-2) per day. Due to
       differences in canopy development this range is maintained
       almost until the end of the growing season. It is demonstrated
       that daily CO2 fluxes can be simulated by a combined
       photosynthesis and soil respiration model. By this approach, it
       is concluded that the photosynthetic capacity is nearly equal
       for all the grain crops (120-140 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) which is
       moreover 30-40\% higher than that of maize and grass. To
       estimate landscape CO2 fluxes, the measurements from the
       individual fields are weighted according to their areal
       contribution. These estimates are found to be in good agreement
       with the direct measurements conducted from the 48 m mast when
       using a three-dimensional (3-D) footprint to define the source
       area. Spatial integration is also used to calculate the annual
       net ecosystem exchange (NEE) which proves to be -31 g C m(-2)
       per year for the landscape as a whole, i.e. there is a net
       transport of CO2 from the atmosphere to the biosphere. This
       value holds, however, only for the specific year and for a
       measurement level close to the ground. The sensitivity of the
       annual NEE to temperature variations is discussed. By comparing
       flux measurements at two levels (48 and 2.5 m), it is
       demonstrated that the CO2 budget for an agricultural area may
       be affected by anthropogenic CO2 sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier

  abstract = {Managed grasslands contribute to global warming by the exchange of the
       greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane. To
       reduce uncertainties of the global warming potential of
       European grasslands and to assess potential mitigation options,
       an integrated approach quantifying fluxes from all three gases
       is needed. Greenhouse gas emissions from a grassland site in
       the SE of Scotland were measured in 2002 and 2003. Closed
       static chambers were used for N2O and CH4 flux measurements,
       and samples were analysed by gas chromatography. Closed dynamic
       chambers were used for soil respiration measurements, using
       infrared gas analysis. Three organic manures and two inorganic
       fertilizers were applied at a rate of 300 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)
       (available N) and compared with a zero-N control on grassland
       plots in a replicated experimental design. Soil respiration
       from plots receiving manure was up to 1.6 times larger than CO2
       release from control plots and up to 1.7 times larger compared
       to inorganic treatments (p < 0.05). A highly significant (p <
       0.001) effect of fertilizer and manure treatments on N2O
       release was observed. Release of N2O from plots receiving
       inorganic fertilizers resulted in short term peaks of up to 388
       g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1). However losses from plots receiving
       organic manures were both longer lasting and greater in
       magnitude, with an emission of up to 3488 g N2O-N ha(-1)
       day(-1) from the sewage sludge treatments. During the 2002
       growing season the cumulative total N2O flux from manure
       treatments was 25 times larger than that from mineral
       fertilizers. CH4 emissions were only significantly increased (p
       < 0.001) for a short period following applications of cattle
       slurry. Although soil respiration in manure plots was high,
       model predictions and micrometeorological flux measurements at
       an adjacent site suggest that all plots receiving fertilizer or
       manure acted as a sink for CO2. Therefore in terms of global
       warming potentials the contribution of N2O from manure
       treatments becomes particularly important. There were
       considerable variations in N2O and CO2 fluxes between years,
       which was related to annual variations in soil temperature and
       rainfall. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Bioenergy cropping systems could help offset greenhouse gas emissions,
       but quantifying that offset is complex. Bioenergy crops offset
       carbon dioxide emissions by converting atmospheric CO2 to
       organic C in crop biomass and soil, but they also emit nitrous
       oxide and vary in their effects on soil oxidation of methane.
       Growing the crops requires energy ( e. g., to operate farm
       machinery, produce inputs such as fertilizer) and so does
       converting the harvested product to usable fuels (feedstock
       conversion efficiency). The objective of this study was to
       quantify all these factors to determine the net effect of
       several bioenergy cropping systems on greenhouse-gas (GHG)
       emissions. We used the DAYCENT biogeochemistry model to assess
       soil GHG fluxes and biomass yields for corn, soybean, alfalfa,
       hybrid poplar, reed canarygrass, and switchgrass as bioenergy
       crops in Pennsylvania, USA. DAYCENT results were combined with
       estimates of fossil fuels used to provide farm inputs and
       operate agricultural machinery and fossil-fuel offsets from
       biomass yields to calculate net GHG fluxes for each cropping
       system considered. Displaced fossil fuel was the largest GHG
       sink, followed by soil carbon sequestration. N2O emissions were
       the largest GHG source. All cropping systems considered
       provided net GHG sinks, even when soil C was assumed to reach a
       new steady state and C sequestration in soil was not counted.
       Hybrid poplar and switchgrass provided the largest net GHG
       sinks, > 200 g CO(2)e-C(.)m(-2) (.) yr(-1) for biomass
       conversion to ethanol, and > 400 g CO(2)e-C(.)m(-2) (.) yr(-1)
       for biomass gasification for electricity generation. Compared
       with the life cycle of gasoline and diesel, ethanol and
       biodiesel from corn rotations reduced GHG emissions by similar
       to 40\%, reed canarygrass by similar to 85\%, and switchgrass and
       hybrid poplar by similar to 115\%.},

       appropriate national inventory on N2O emissions from
       agricultural land use, in order to report properly on the
       achievements made in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The
       search for the appropriate method is a controversial topic as
       it is subject to high uncertainty in particular associated to
       the upscaling from site measurements. In this study, all
       available data from Germany on annual N2O-emission rates
       derived from field experiments of at least an entire year are
       summarized. From each study, only differences in soil
       properties on N input qualified as an individual data set.
       Under these premises, 101 treatments from 27 sites were found
       equally spread across Germany. The annual N application ranged
       from 0 to 400 kg N ha(-1) and the annual emission rates from
       0.04 to 17.1 kg ha(-1). Annual emission factors (EFs),
       uncorrected for background emission, varied considerably from
       0.18\% to 15.54\% of N applied. There was no nationwide
       correlation found for the relationship between N2O losses and N
       application, soil C, soil N, soil texture, or soil pH. However,
       site-specific trends in the relationship between emission
       factor and mean soil aeration status, as expressed by the soil
       type and/or mean climatic conditions, were revealed. Regularly
       water-logged soils were characterized by low emission factors
       as were soils from the drier regions (< 600 mm y(-1)), whereas
       well-aerated soils from the frost-intensive regions showed
       exceptionally high emission factors. Since purely physical and
       chemical parameterization failed to describe N2O emissions from
       agricultural land use on the national scale, there must be a
       biological adaptation to mean site conditions, i.e., different
       microbial communities react differently to similar actual
       conditions in terms of N2O dynamics. Regardless of the point of
       view, the chapter on N2O Soil dynamics cannot be closed yet,
       and new additional model concepts, process studies, and field
       measurements are needed.},

       reduce the dependence on synthetic chemical fertilizer.
       However, these organic amendments also effect the emissions of
       greenhouse gas (GHG) from soil. Influence of different organic
       amendments on emissions of GHG from soil and their global
       warming potential (GWP) was studied in a field experiment in
       rice-wheat cropping system of Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). There
       was 28\% increase in CH4 emissions on addition of 25\% N through
       Sesbania GM along with urea compared to urea alone.
       Substitution of 100\% inorganic N by organic sources lead to a
       60\% increase in CH4 emissions. The carbon equivalent emission
       from rice-wheat systems varied between 3816 and 4886 kg C
       equivalent ha(-1) depending upon fertilizer and organic
       amendment. GWP of rice-wheat system increased by 28\% on full
       substitution of organic N by chemical N. However, the C
       efficiency ratios of the GM and crop residue treatments were at
       par with the recommended inorganic fertilizer treatment. Thus
       use of organic amendments along with inorganic fertilizer
       increases the GWP of the rice-wheat system but may improve the
       soil fertility status without adversely affecting the C
       efficiency ratio. However, the trade-off between improved yield
       and soil health versus GHG emissions should be taken into
       account while promoting the practice of farming with organic
       residues substitution for mineral fertilizer. (c) 2005 Elsevier

  abstract = {[1] This work presents a new dynamic global vegetation model designed
       as an extension of an existing surface-vegetation-atmosphere
       transfer scheme which is included in a coupled ocean-atmosphere
       general circulation model. The new dynamic global vegetation
       model simulates the principal processes of the continental
       biosphere influencing the global carbon cycle (photosynthesis,
       autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration of plants and in
       soils, fire, etc.) as well as latent, sensible, and kinetic
       energy exchanges at the surface of soils and plants. As a
       dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly represents competitive
       processes such as light competition, sapling establishment,
       etc. It can thus be used in simulations for the study of
       feedbacks between transient climate and vegetation cover
       changes, but it can also be used with a prescribed vegetation
       distribution. The whole seasonal phenological cycle is
       prognostically calculated without any prescribed dates or use
       of satellite data. The model is coupled to the IPSL-CM4 coupled
       atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model. Carbon and surface energy
       fluxes from the coupled hydrology-vegetation model compare well
       with observations at FluxNet sites. Simulated vegetation
       distribution and leaf density in a global simulation are
       evaluated against observations, and carbon stocks and fluxes
       are compared to available estimates, with satisfying results.},

  abstract = {In winter crops, leaf area is a major determinant of the final yield,
       and is substantially affected by losses occurring during
       vegetative growth. Here, we propose and test a submodel
       simulating the development of leaf area and pod area, along
       with leaf senescence, for winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus
       L.), which was included in a CERES-type model for rape adapted
       from CERES-N Maize. This crop model, called CERES-Rape, has
       components for crop phenology, net photosynthesis, N uptake,
       and assimilate partitioning. As a new feature compared to
       previously published work, che leaf area submodel includes
       senescence from shading due to competition for light in the
       canopy, and from leaf N deficiencies. The model has been
       developed and parameterised on a 1-yr-long experiment with
       three fertilizer N treatments in northeastern France, during
       which measurements of senescing parts allowed calibration of
       the equations for leaf area index (LAI) senescence and total
       generated LAI. The leaf area submodel, once coupled to the
       CERES-Rape model, was tested against two additional experiments
       from Denmark and northern France. This process-oriented
       submodel proved accurate for the simulation of actual LAI
       whether in the calibration or in the validation phase, with an
       overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.496 m(2) m(-2),
       falling close to the mean experimental standard deviation.
       Extrapolation did not require any further adjustment, although
       a different cultivar was involved. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science
