  title = {Cumulative Effects of Concurrent Actions on Numeric-Valued Fluents},
  abstract = {We propose a situation calculus formalization of action domains that include numeric-valued fluents (so-called additive or measure fluents) and concurrency. Our approach allows formalizing concurrent actions whose effect s increment/decrement the value of additive fluents. For describing indirect effects, we employ mathematical equations in a manner that is inspired by recent work on causality and structural equations.}
