  abstract =     "The future of computer aided design is in object
                 oriented programming. If the database community hopes
                 to participate in this future, it must reexamine some
                 basic assumptions about the architecture of database
                 systems. Database system functionality can be added to
                 object systems but if the performance cost is too high,
                 it will never survive. Below are some suggestions for
                 what can be done at a reasonable performance cost.
                 \par

                 The object oriented paradigm provides a more practical
                 approach to the partitioning of the global database
                 than horizontal and vertical partitioning of relational
                 tables. Each partition should itself be an independent
                 database containing related data such as the geometry
                 of a part or the spacial relationship of parts in an
                 assembly. A meta-database would be used to control
                 access to collections of these partitions. A collection
                 of partitions comprise the database for a user's design
                 session. \par

                 The overhead of traditional database transaction
                 management is not acceptable for high performance CAD
                 systems. With the partitioning scheme described above,
                 transaction management can be performed at a
                 partition/session granularity. Once the user has
                 composed the collection of partitions, he has a single
                 user database. There is no need for concurrency control
                 or transaction logging except at the meta-database
                 level. This type of transaction management can in fact
                 be more functional than traditional transaction
                 management, allowing for versioning, long transactions,
                 integrity checking and archival. \par

                 Object oriented databases need a message model, not a
                 data model. Any object which responds to the same
                 messages as an object of ``Duck'' class (walk and
                 quack) is, for all intents and purposes, a duck. An
                 attempt to design a data model based on instance
                 variables of an object or based on collections of
                 objects of like class violates the data abstraction
                 facilities of object oriented languages and diminishes
                 their power. An attempt to implement a relational
                 database system with an object oriented language yields
                 a relational database system where you get abstract
                 data types for free. It does not yield an object
                 oriented database system. \par

                 For object oriented queries, the message is the media.
                 A query can be transformed into an execution plan
                 consisting of messages sent to database objects.
                 Optimization decisions can be made by sending messages
                 to referenced objects. Collection classes can be
                 implemented for new access methods with cost and
                 selectivity methods to provide optimization
                 information. In this way, the query language can grow
                 with the application. \par

                 Data representation is an important aspect of object
                 oriented systems. Most object systems are typeless in
                 that all instance variables of an object are object
                 references. For performance sake, object systems should
                 provide enough of a type mechanism to allow simple data
                 items (integers, floats, characters, \ldots{}) to be
                 represented in the form intrinsic to the machine.
                 Methods can then be compiled for access to typed data.
                 \par

                 In conclusion, object systems provide enormous
                 potential for the development of CAD systems.
                 Performance influences the approach taken to an
                 application. WYSIWYG publishing applications were not
                 attempted until performance was adequate. Functionality
                 is what sells CAD systems. Database system
                 functionality can be added to object systems at a
                 reasonable cost.",

                 are likely to face large access plan spaces in their
                 task. Exhaustively searching such access plan spaces is
                 unacceptable. We propose a query optimization algorithm
                 based on {\em simulated annealing}, which is a
                 probabilistic hill climbing algorithm. We show the
                 specific formulation of the algorithm for the case of
                 optimizing complex non-recursive queries that arise in
                 the study of linear recursion. The query answer is
                 explicitly represented and manipulated within the {\em
                 closed semiring\/} of linear relational operators. The
                 optimization algorithm is applied to a state space that
                 is constructed from the equivalent algebraic forms of
                 the query answer. A prototype of the simulated
                 annealing algorithm has been built and few experiments
                 have been performed for a limited class of relational
                 operators. Our initial experience is that, in general,
                 the algorithm converges to processing strategies that
                 are very close to the optimal. Moreover, the
                 traditional processing strategies (e.g., the {\em

                 have a model, and that it may have more than one
                 minimal model. We impose syntactic restriction in order
                 to define a deterministic language. These restrictions
                 allow only layered (stratified) programs. We prove that
                 for any program satisfying the syntactic restrictions

                 model can be constructed in a bottom-up fashion.

                 techniques that we study form a hierarchy, which
                 generalizes relations of constants. This hierarchy
                 ranges from the very simple Codd-table, (i.e., a
                 relation of constants and distinct variables called
                 nulls, which stand for values present but unknown), to
                 much more complex mechanisms involving views on
                 conditioned-tables, (i.e., queries on Codd-tables
                 together with conditions). The views we consider are
                 the queries that have polynomial data-complexity on
                 complete information databases. Our conditions are
                 conjunctions of equalities and inequalities. \par

                 (1) We provide matching upper and lower bounds on the
                 data-complexity of testing {\em containment}, {\em
                 membership}, and {\em uniqueness\/} for sets of
                 possible worlds and we fully classify these problems
                 with respect to our representation hierarchy. The most
                 surprising result in this classification is that it is
                 complete in $2^p$, whether a set of possible worlds
                 represented by a Codd-table is a subset of a set of
                 possible worlds represented by a Codd-table with one
                 conjunction of inequalities. \par

                 (2) We investigate the data-complexity of querying
                 incomplete information databases. We examine both
                 asking for {\em certain facts\/} and for {\em possible
                 facts}. Our approach is algebraic but our bounds also
                 apply to logical databases. We show that asking for a
                 certain fact is coNP-complete, even for a fixed first
                 order query on a Codd-table. We thus strengthen a lower
                 bound of [16], who showed that this holds for a
                 Codd-table with a conjunction of inequalities. For each
                 fixed positive existential query we present a
                 polynomial algorithm solving the bounded possible fact
                 problem of this query on conditioned-tables. We show
                 that our approach is, in a sense, the best possible, by
                 deriving two NP-completeness lower bounds for the
                 bounded possible fact problem when the fixed query

                 situation is studied where the initial bindings in the

                 space and ensure safety of execution. Two key
                 techniques previously proposed to solve this problem
                 are (i) the highly efficient counting method, and (ii)
                 the magic set method which is safe in a wider range of

                 precompilation level, iteration level, tuple processing
                 level and file accessing level. Techniques for reducing
                 redundant work at each level are studied. In the
                 precompilation level, the optimization techniques
                 include removing redundant parts in a rule cluster,
                 simplifying recursive clusters and sharing common
                 subexpressions among rules. At the iteration level, the
                 techniques discussed are the use of frontier relations
                 and the counting method. At the tuple processing level,
                 we use merging and filtering methods to exclude
                 processed drivers from database reaccessing. Finally,
                 at the file accessing level, I/O cost can be further
                 reduced by level relaxation. We conclude that even for
                 complex recursion, redundant database processing can be
                 considerably reduced or eliminated by developing

  abstract =     "Increased interest in using workstations and small
                 processors for distributed transaction processing
                 raises the question of how to implement the logs needed
                 for transaction recovery. Although logs can be
                 implemented with data written to duplexed disks on each
                 processing node, this paper argues there are advantages
                 if log data is written to multiple {\em log server\/}
                 nodes. A simple analysis of expected logging loads
                 leads to the conclusion that a high performance,
                 microprocessor based processing node can support a log
                 server if it uses efficient communication protocols and
                 low latency, non volatile storage to buffer log data.
                 The buffer is needed to reduce the processing time per
                 log record and to increase throughput to the logging
                 disk. An interface to the log servers using simple,
                 robust, and efficient protocols is presented. Also
                 described are the disk data structures that the log
                 servers use. This paper concludes with a brief
                 discussion of remaining design issues, the status of a
                 prototype implementation, and plans for its

                 addressing the problem of designing high-performance
                 database systems for managing memory-resident data. In
                 this paper we address the recovery problem in the

                 database recovery schemes fall short of meeting the
                 requirements of such a system, and we present a new
                 recovery mechanism which is designed to overcome their
                 shortcomings. The proposed mechanism takes advantage of
                 a few megabytes of reliable memory in order to organize
                 recovery information on a per ``object'' basis. As a
                 result, it is able to amortize the cost of checkpoints
                 over a controllable number of updates, and it is also
                 able to separate post-crash recovery into two
                 phases--high-speed recovery of data which is needed
                 immediately by transactions, and background recovery of
                 the remaining portions of the database. A simple
                 performance analysis is undertaken, and the results
                 suggest our mechanism should perform well in a

                 have done and related work that influenced me,
                 concerning deductive databases over the last 30 years.
                 It will be convenient to divide this time period into
                 roughly three equal parts, 1957 - 1968, 1969 - 1978,
                 1979 - present. For the first portion I will describe
                 how my interest started in deductive databases in 1957,
                 at a time when not even the field of databases existed
                 I will describe work in the beginning years, leading to
                 the start of deductive databases in about 1968 with the
                 work of Cordell Green and Bertram Raphael. \par

                 The second period saw a great deal of work in theorem
                 proving as well as the introduction of logic
                 programming. The existence and importance of deductive
                 databases as a formal and viable discipline received
                 its impetus at a workshop held in Toulouse, France, in
                 1977, which culminated in the book, Logic and Data
                 Bases. The relationship of deductive databases and
                 logic programming was recognized at that time. During
                 the third and most recent period we have seen formal
                 theories of databases come about as an outgrowth of
                 that work, and the recognition that artificial
                 intelligence and deductive databases are closely
                 related, at least through the so-called expert database
                 systems. I expect that the relationships between
                 techniques from formal logic, databases, logic
                 programming, and artificial intelligence will continue
                 to be explored and the field of deductive databases
                 will become a more prominent area of computer science
                 in coming years.",

                 of a special class of indefinite deductive databases,

                 and Walker [ABW] and Van Gelder [VG] in which recursion
                 ``through'' negation is disallowed. \par

                 A stratified database has a natural model associated

                 developed for two applicative programming languages,
                 BLU and HLU. BLU is a very simple language with only
                 five primitives, and is designed primarily as a tool
                 for the implementation of higher level languages. The
                 semantics of BLU are formally developed at two levels
                 possible worlds and clausal and the latter is shown to
                 be a correct implementation of the former. HLU is a
                 user level update language. It is defined entirely in
                 terms of BLU, and so immediately inherits its semantic
                 definition from that language. This demonstrates a
                 level of completeness for BLU as a level of primitives

                 of a relational database management system (DBMS). It
                 is the responsibility of this component to translate
                 the user-submitted query - usually written in a
                 non-procedural language - into an efficient query
                 evaluation plan (QEP) which is then executed against
                 the database. The research literature describes a wide
                 variety of optimization strategies for different query
                 languages and implementation environments. However,
                 very little is known about how to design and structure
                 the query optimization component to implement these
                 strategies. \par

                 This paper proposes a first step towards the design of
                 a {\em modular query optimizer}. We describe its
                 operations by {\em transformation rules\/} which
                 generate different QEPs from initial query
                 specifications. As we distinguish different aspects of
                 the query optimization process, our hope is that the
                 approach taken in this paper will contribute to the
                 more general goal of a modular query optimizer as part

                 be integrated into the kernel and what features are
                 rather application-specific? Kernel features must be

                 {$H$} + and {\em YE\/} ++ which differ from {$H$} and
                 {\em YE\/} + in that the use of equality (=) and
                 inequality () is prohibited. We show that {$H$} + is
                 more expressive than {\em YE\/} ++ and that any {$H$} +
                 program can be transformed into an equivalent {$H$} +

                 we propose the notion of a saga. A LLT is a saga if it

                 implementation are relatively simple, but they have the
                 potential to improve performance significantly. We

                 sagas, including how they can be run on an existing

                 for approximating the distribution of node occupancies
                 in hierarchical data structures which store a variable
                 number of geometric data items per node. The basic idea
                 is to describe a dynamic data structure as a set of
                 populations which are permitted to transform into one
                 another according to certain rules. The transformation
                 rules are used to obtain a set of equations describing
                 a population distribution which is stable under
                 insertion of additional information into the structure.
                 These equations can then be solved, either analytically
                 or numerically, to obtain the population distribution.
                 Hierarchical data structures are modeled by letting
                 each population represent the nodes of a given
                 occupancy. A detailed analysis of quadtree data
                 structures for storing point data is presented, and the
                 results are compared to experimental data. Two
                 phenomena referred to as {\em aging\/} and {\em
                 phasing\/} are defined and shown to account for the
                 differences between the experimental results and those

                 support of engineering applications is the concept of
                 object-oriented database management. Object-orientation
                 is usually approached from either a behavioral or
                 structural viewpoint. The former emphasizes the
                 application-specific manipulation of technical objects

                 latter concentrates on the structural aspects and their
                 efficient implementation. The thesis of the paper is
                 that the two viewpoints may enter into a fruitful
                 symbiosis where a behaviorally object-oriented system
                 is implemented on top of a structurally object-oriented
                 database system, thereby combining ease of use by the
                 engineer with high database system performance. The

                 ``sensibly'' once disjunction, negation, and universal
                 quantification are allowed. The class of relational
                 calculus queries, or formulas, that have ``sensible''
                 answers is called the {\em domain independent\/} class,
                 which is known to be undecidable. Subsequent research
                 has focused on identifying large decidable subclasses
                 of domain independent formulas In this paper we
                 investigate the properties of two such classes the {\em
                 evaluable\/} formulas and the {\em allowed\/} formulas.
                 Although both classes have been defined before, we give
                 simplified definitions, present short proofs of their
                 man properties, and describe a method to incorporate
                 equality. \par

                 Although evaluable queries have sensible answers, it is
                 not straightforward to compute them efficiently or
                 correctly. We introduce {\em relational algebra normal
                 form\/} for formulas from which form the correct
                 translation into relational algebra is trivial. We give
                 algorithms to transform an evaluable formula into an
                 equivalent {\em allowed\/} formula, and from there into
                 relational algebra normal form. Our algorithms avoid
                 use of the so-called {\em Dom\/} relation, consisting
                 of all constants appearing in the database or the
                 query. \par

                 Finally, we describe a restriction under which every
                 domain independent formula is evaluable, and argue that
                 evaluable formulas may be the largest decidable
                 subclass of the domain independent formulas that can be
                 efficiently recognized.",

                 variable appearing in the head of a rule must also
                 appear in the body of the rule. The input of a program
                 is a set of ground atoms (which are given in addition
                 to the program's rules) and, therefore, can be viewed
                 as an assignment of relations to some of the program's
                 predicates. Two programs are equivalent if they produce
                 the same result for all possible assignments of
                 relations to the extensional predicates (i.e., the
                 predicates that do not appear as heads of rules). Two
                 programs are uniformly equivalent if they produce the
                 same result for all possible assignments of initial
                 relations to all the predicates (i.e., both extensional
                 and intentional). The equivalence problem for Datalog
                 programs is known to be undecidable. It is shown that
                 uniform equivalence is decidable, and an algorithm is
                 given for minimizing a Datalog program under uniform
                 equivalence. A technique for removing parts of a
                 program that are redundant under equivalence (but not
                 under uniform equivalence) is developed. A procedure
                 for testing uniform equivalence is also developed for

                 highly parallel and pipelined multiprocessor join
                 algorithms using sort-merge and hashing techniques.
                 Among them, two algorithms are parallel and pipelined
                 versions of traditional sort-merge join methods, two
                 algorithms use both hashing and sort-merge techniques,
                 and another two are variations of the hybrid hash join
                 algorithms. The performance of those algorithms is
                 evaluated analytically against a generic database
                 machine architecture. The methodology used in the

                 problems similar to those encountered by virtual memory
                 managers. The paging behavior of existing automatic
                 storage reclamation schemes as applied to objects
                 stored in a database management system is one indicator
                 of the performance cost of various features of storage
                 reclamation algorithms. The results of modeling the
                 paging behavior suggest that Mark and Sweep causes many
                 more input/output operations than Copy-Compact. A
                 contributing factor to the expense of Mark and Sweep is
                 that it does not recluster memory as does Copy-Compact.
                 If memory is not reclustered, the average cost of
                 accessing data can go up tremendously. Other algorithms
                 that do not recluster memory also suffer performance
                 problems, namely all reference counting schemes. The
                 main advantage of a reference count scheme is that it
                 does not force a running program to pause for a long
                 period of time while reclamation takes place, it
                 amortizes the cost of reclamation across all accesses.
                 The reclustering of Copy-Compact and the cost
                 amortization of Reference Count are combined to great
                 advantage in Baker's algorithm. This algorithm proves

                 translate the commands into ones on the base relations.
                 An alternative approach has been proposed recently,
                 whereby materialized copies of views are kept, and
                 incrementally updated immediately after each
                 modification of the database. A related scheme exists,
                 in which update of materialized views is deferred until
                 just before data is retrieved from the view. A
                 performance analysis is presented comparing the cost of
                 query modification, immediate view maintenance, and
                 deferred view maintenance. Three different models of
                 the structure of views are given a simple selection and
                 projection of one relation, the natural join of two
                 relations, and an aggregate (e.g., the sum of values in

                 developed at the University of Colorado. The
                 implementation is self-adaptive and concurrent, and
                 runs in the Unix/C Sun workstation environment. A
                 central, unique focus of Cactis is the support of
                 functionally-defined data in a manner which provides
                 good performance. Cactis is intended for use in
                 applications which are conducive to an object-oriented
                 approach and involve derived data. Such applications
                 include software environments. \par

                 Cactis supports the construction of objects and
                 type/subtype hierarchies, which are useful for managing
                 the complex and highly-interrelated data found in
                 software environments. Such data types include
                 programs, requirement specifications, milestone
                 reports, configurations, documentation, and many
                 others. Cactis uses techniques based on attributed
                 graphs to ensure that functionally-defined attributes
                 of objects, such as compilation dependencies, cost
                 calculations, and milestone dependencies can be
                 maintained efficiently. Since it is necessary to
                 dynamically add new tools (such as debuggers and
                 compilers) to a software environment, the DBMS allows
                 the user to extend the type structure. The system also
                 supports an efficient rollback and recovery mechanism,

  abstract =     "Extensible query optimization requires that the
                 ``repertoire'' of alternative strategies for executing
                 queries be represented as data, not embedded in the
                 optimizer code. Recognizing that query optimizers are
                 essentially expert systems, several researchers have
                 suggested using strategy rules to transform query
                 execution plans into alternative or better plans.
                 Though extremely flexible, these systems can be very
                 inefficient at any step in the processing, many rules
                 may be eligible for application and complicated
                 conditions must be tested to determine that eligibility
                 during unification. We present a constructive,
                 ``building blocks'' approach to defining alternative
                 plans, in which the rules defining alternatives are an
                 extension of the productions of a grammar to resemble
                 the definition of a function in mathematics. The
                 extensions permit each token of the grammar to be
                 parametrized and each of its alternative definitions to
                 have a complex condition. The terminals of the grammar
                 are base-level database operations on tables that are
                 interpreted at run-time. The non-terminals are defined
                 declaratively by production rules that combine those
                 operations into meaningful plans for execution. Each
                 production produces a set of alternative plans, each
                 having a vector of properties, including the estimated
                 cost of producing that plan. Productions can require
                 certain properties of their inputs, such as tuple order
                 and location, and we describe a ``glue'' mechanism for
                 augmenting plans to achieve the required properties. We
                 give detailed examples to illustrate the power and
                 robustness of our rules and to contrast them with
                 related ideas.",

                 which maps a database {$D$} to an output type {\em T},
                 an {\em intermediate type\/} is a type which is used by
                 some variable of the query, but which is not present in
                 {$D$} or {\em T}. For each $k$, $i$ ? 0 we define CALC
                 {\em k,i\/} to be the family of calculus queries
                 mapping from and to types with set-height $k$ and using
                 intermediate types with set-height $i$ In particular,
                 CALC 0,0 is the relational calculus, and CALC 0,1 is
                 equivalent to the family of second-order (relational)
                 queries \par

                 Several results concerning these families of languages
                 are obtained. A primary focus is on the families CALC
                 0,i, which map relations to relations Upper bounds on

                 is shown that CALC 0,3 has at least the complexity of
                 exponential space. The CALC 0,i hierarchy does not
                 collapse, because for each {\em i}, CALC 0,i is
                 strictly less expressive than CALC 0,i+2. The union 0i
                 CALC 0,i is strictly less expressive than the family of
                 `computable' database queries. \par

                 calculus interpreted using a semantics based on the use
                 of arbitrarily large finite numbers of {\em invented
                 values\/} is studied. Under this semantics, the
                 expressive power of the relational calculus is not
                 increased, and the CALC 0,i hierarchy collapses at CALC
                 0,1. We also consider queries which use a bounded

                 ``Highly-parallel'' implies that load balancing is a
                 critical performance issue. ``Data-intensive'' means
                 data is so large that operations should be executed

                 present experimental results using a specific workload

                 researchers have argued the benefits of declustering (i

                 show that as declustering is increased, load balancing
                 continues to improve. However, for transactions
                 involving complex joins, further declustering reduces

                 that users may have a variety of intended models for
                 programs and that a single program may give different
                 intended models under different assumptions of
                 semantics. Our conclusion is that it is impossible to
                 infer the intended model from the syntax of the program

                 define a rule algebra. The user formulates a program as
                 an algebraic specification that directs the execution
                 towards the intended model. The interesting question at

                 effective computability}. Safety is the property that
                 the set of answers for a given query is finite. A
                 related issues is whether the evaluation strategy can
                 effectively compute all answers and terminate. We

                 constraints\/} and {\em monotonicity constraints\/} are

                 safety and effective computability of predicates in
                 arbitrarily complex cliques. This algorithm takes
                 certain procedures as parameters, and its applicability

                 projection operators, thus admitting both horizontal
                 and vertical decompositions. The realization of
                 restrictions is enabled through the use of a Boolean
                 algebra of types, while true independence of
                 projections is modelled by permitting null values in
                 the base schema. The flavor of the approach is
                 algebraic, with the collection of all candidate views
                 of a decomposition modelled within a lattice-like
                 framework, and the actual decompositions arising as
                 Boolean subalgebraic. Central to the framework is the
                 notion of {\em sidimensional join dependency}, which
                 generalizes the classical notion of join dependency by
                 allowing the components of the join to be selected
                 horizontally as well as vertically. Several properties
                 of such dependencies are presented, including a
                 generalization of many of the classical results known

                 characterization of the nature of dependencies which
                 participate in decompositions is presented. It is shown
                 that there are two major types, the bidimensional join
                 dependencies, which are tuple generating and allow
                 tuple removal by implicit encoding of knowledge, and

                 practice and how can they be achieved with practical
                 files? This paper considers the problem of achieving
                 analytical performance of hashing techniques in
                 practice with reference to successful search lengths,
                 unsuccessful search lengths and the expected worst case

                 explicitly link the analytical results to performance

                 experimental results deal mostly with successful search
                 lengths. We show why the well known division method

                 the test file. We formulate and justify an hypothesis

                 hashing functions, the analytical performance can be
                 obtained in practice on real life files. Experimental
                 results presented strongly support our hypothesis.

  abstract =     "In this paper we investigate the problem of
                 synchronising transactions in an object base. An object
                 base is a collection of objects, much the way a
                 database is a collection of data. An object, for our
                 purposes, consists of a collection of variables (whose
                 values at any point in time comprise the state of that
                 object) and a set of operations, called methods, that
                 are the only means of accessing (sensing or modifying)
                 the object's variables \par

                 There is a certain sense in which a traditional
                 database is an object base. It consists of ``objects''
                 (records, tuples or what have you) each of which has a
                 state that can be accessed only through the operations
                 Read and Write. The main difference is that in an
                 object base, each object supplies its own methods and
                 these are arbitrary. In particular, a method for a
                 certain object may call methods of other objects to
                 carry out its task. In contrast to certain models in
                 which objects correspond to ``levels of abstraction'',
                 our model is completely general in this respect for
                 example, it is permissible for a method of object {$A$}
                 to call a method of object {$B$} which, in turn, may
                 call some other method of object {$A$} again \par

                 One implication of this difference between data and
                 object bases is that in the latter the assumption,
                 commonly made in the former, that the operations which
                 manipulate the state of the objects are short enough to
                 be implemented serially (one at a time) is no longer
                 valid. A related implication is that in object bases we
                 are faced with the necessity of dealing with nested
                 transactions, since the invocation of one method may
                 result in further method invocations \par

                 Another, less fundamental, difference between data and
                 object bases is that, in addition to being of uniform
                 type, the ``objects'' of a database are usually assumed
                 to be of uniform size as well. In an object base one
                 can imagine objects of widely differing sizes. A clock
                 and the New York City telephone directory could be
                 objects differing in size by orders of magnitude, yet
                 co-existing in the same object base \par

                 In spite of these differences it is possible to
                 approach concurrency control in an object base in the
                 following way. Each object is viewed as a database
                 item. Further, each method invocation is treated as a
                 group of Read or Write operations on those data items
                 that were accessed as a result of that method
                 invocation. With these analogies, any conventional
                 database concurrency control method (two-phase locking,
                 timestamp ordering, certification, and the whole lot)
                 can be employed to synchronise concurrent transactions
                 in the object base. This approach has the virtue of
                 simplicity and may be well-suited to certain
                 environments. It is, for example, the approach taken in
                 the GemStone project and product (cf Maier and Stein
                 [1987], Purdy {\em et al\/} [1987]) \par

                 We are interested in exploring approaches to
                 concurrency control in object bases which take into
                 account their special features and differences from
                 databases. The hope is that this will lead to more
                 efficient techniques. More specifically, we would like
                 to consider mechanisms that \par

                 Take into account the nested nature of transactions
                 \par

                 Allow methods accessing an object to execute
                 concurrently (but correctly) This seems especially
                 important as multiprocessors become available, since
                 forcing serial access to an object's methods restricts
                 parallelism (bear in mind that each method could be a
                 lengthy procedure) \par

                 Are modular, in that each object is responsible for
                 synchronizing the invocations of its own methods as it
                 sees fit \par

                 The first two of these points have been considered by
                 others as well. For example, Argus (cf Liskov and
                 Scheifler [1983]) uses a synchronisation algorithm
                 which is an adaptation of strict two-phase locking in a
                 nested transaction environment. In addition, Argus
                 allows multiple concurrent invo",

  abstract =     "As the size and complexity of processing and
                 manufacturing systems increases, the need for Database
                 Management Systems (DBMS) that meet the special needs
                 of studies that experiment with such systems becomes
                 more current. System analysts who study the performance
                 of modern processing systems have to manipulate large
                 amounts of data in order to profile the behavior of the
                 system. They have to identify the relationship between
                 the properties of a compound system and a wide spectrum
                 of performance metrics. In a recent study in which we
                 have analyzed a set of distributed concurrency control
                 algorithms, we performed more than 1400 simulation
                 experiments. Each experiment was characterized by more
                 than 6000 input parameters and generated more than 400
                 output values. It is thus clear that powerful means for
                 defining the structure and properties of complex
                 systems are needed, as well as efficient tools to
                 retrieve the data accumulated in the course of the
                 study. We are currently engaged in an effort to develop
                 and implement the DE {\em LAB simulation laboratory\/}
                 that aims to provide such means and tools for
                 simulation studies. \par

                 The goal of the first phase of this effort was to
                 design and implement a simulation language. It ended in
                 1986 when the DE {\em NET\/} (Discrete Event NETwork)
                 simulation language became operational. The language is
                 based on the concept of Discrete Event System
                 Specifications (DEVS). It views the simulator as a
                 collection of self contained objects that communicate
                 via Discrete Event Connectors that provide a unified
                 synchronization protocol In the past two years the
                 language has been used in a number of real life
                 studies. It was used to simulate distributed processing
                 environments, communication protocols, and production
                 lines Several tools have been developed around the
                 language. All tools adhere to the same modeling
                 methodology and thus create a cohesive simulation
                 environment. \par

                 In the second phase of the DE {\em LAB\/} project we
                 have been addressing the data management problem DE
                 {\em NET\/} has been interfaced to a special purpose
                 relational DBMS that can store descriptions of
                 simulation runs and provides access to the stored data
                 Based on our experience with thus DBMS, we have reached
                 the conclusion that system analysts need to be provided
                 with a view of the data that differs from the way the
                 DE {\em NET\/} program views the data, and thus decided
                 to develop a data model that meets their needs. The
                 M@@@@SE data model, which is the result of this effort,
                 has an {\em object oriented\/} flavor. It was developed
                 with the guidance of potential users and was tested on
                 a number of real life simulation studies. \par

                 Although the conception of M@@@@SE was motivated by the
                 specific needs of a simulation laboratory, we believe
                 that it addresses the representational needs of many
                 other environments We have decided to support the
                 notion of an {\em object}. Every object is assigned a
                 unique identifier. Depending on their properties
                 (attributes), objects can simultaneously belong to
                 several {\em classes}, inheriting properties from all
                 of them. Among these classes, one is characterized as
                 the {\em primary\/} class of the object. The notion of
                 a primary class helps achieving a ``conceptual'' as
                 well as a physical clustering among similar objects.
                 Collections of objects are supported as regular objects
                 in M@@@@SE in the form of sets, multisets (bags), and
                 arrays. The {\em extent\/} of a class, i.e., the
                 objects that are known members of the class, is
                 explicitly stored in the database. Every M@@@@SE
                 database schema has a straightforward directed graph
                 representation. Each node represents a class of objects
                 and is labeled by the class name. Relationships between
                 the classes in the schema are captured by the arcs of
                 the graph. Similarly to most object-oriented data
                 models, M@@@@SE has two major types of arcs {\em
                 component arcs\/} and {\em inheritance arcs}\ldots{}

  abstract =     "{\em HutBase\/} is a visual design data manager that
                 can be used to store and manipulate data objects
                 created and processed by a variety of design
                 applications. In particular, HutBase allows the user to
                 manipulate the data and start applications, and
                 provides a access mechanism for the applications.
                 \par

                 HutBase consists of three software layers. The lowest
                 layer, the {\em Object Management System\/} (OMS), is
                 based on the Entity-Relationship model and includes
                 those basic operations related to the storage and
                 access of design data objects that are common to all
                 applications. The database is divided into {\em
                 workspaces}, which are collections of OMS {\em
                 objects\/} and {\em relationships\/} organized
                 according to an application-dependent schema and
                 forming a significant whole (e.g., a design project)
                 from the user's point of view Workspace is also the
                 unit for locking and access control. \par

                 An object is a collection of {\em attributes}. Each
                 attribute has a name and value. The name is a string
                 and the value is an arbitrary sequence of bytes. The
                 value of an attribute can be of any length, from a
                 single integer to an external representation of a
                 complicated geometric model. A relationship is a named
                 directed connection between two objects. Relationships
                 have attributes like objects. \par

                 The OMS library contains functions for creating,
                 opening and removing workspaces, objects, relationships
                 and attributes. All operations are carried out within
                 {\em transactions}. The functions do not change the
                 permanent data on the disk until the user calls the
                 {\em save_changes\/} function, which saves the current
                 state of all workspaces opened in a given transaction.
                 \par

                 The next layer is a prototype data model built on top
                 of OMS, which stores the objects in each workspace as a
                 hierarchical tree by means of relationships. The leaves
                 of the hierarchy are called {\em representations\/} and
                 contain the actual data manipulated by the
                 applications. Each representation is associated with a
                 {\em representation type}, which in turn are linked to
                 the application programs, or {\em tools}. The
                 representation types and tools are stored as objects in
                 a separate workspace. \par

                 The top level contains a user interface and a
                 procedural application interface. The user interface
                 shows the available representation types, tools, and
                 contents of one or more workspaces in iconic form. A
                 representation can be opened by selecting its icon on
                 the screen. The tool corresponding to the type of the
                 representation is then started with a handle to the
                 representation as argument. The interface also allows
                 the user to create, remove and copy objects. \par

                 The tool programs run as subprocesses of the HutBase
                 process. Tools access the data base by remote procedure
                 calls that send data base requests from the tool
                 process to the HutBase process. The tools can also
                 create relationships between representations and
                 navigate in the workspace by following the relationship
                 links. \par

                 We are currently working on a interpreted definition
                 language that can be used to describe the structure of
                 a workspace. The definition language will be based on
                 an object-oriented notation, where object and relation
                 types form a class hierarchy. Class descriptions
                 include (possibly inherited) methods for dealing with
                 the various HutBase operations. With the contemplated
                 description facility, new object and relationship types
                 can be defined by declaring new subclasses of the
                 existing ones.",

                 Decision Assistance System), this expert system, using
                 disorder patterns consisting of features such as
                 symptoms and laboratory results, is able to diagnose
                 multiple disorders. Database technology has been used
                 in MEDAS to develop knowledge engineering tools, called
                 the TOOL BOX, which permit domain experts to create
                 knowledge without the assistance of a knowledge
                 engineer. \par

                 In the process of knowledge development with the TOOL
                 BOX a standardization of terms was needed. This led us
                 to design a Feature Dictionary and a grammar to support
                 a standardized format for features. A common dictionary
                 of features will allow us to merge knowledge bases,
                 translate between multi-domain bases, and compare
                 competing expert systems. In addition, standard
                 terminology will assist communication across domains
                 \par

                 The Feature Dictionary has the following attributes
                 {\em Long\/} forms of the feature name (White Blood
                 Count) and {\em short\/} forms (WBC) as well as a three
                 line description of the feature. The {\em type}, binary
                 (Abdominal Pain), continuous-valued (WBC), or derived
                 (pulse pressure = systolic - diastolic) is also kept
                 for each feature \par

                 For value features the appropriate {\em unit\/} (cc,
                 kg, etc.) as well as {\em range\/} limits are stored so
                 that these can be used as a form of quality control on
                 input. The {\em permanence\/} (Y/N) of each feature is
                 kept so it is possible to automatically include
                 permanent features in future encounters. In addition,
                 for each feature three separate `` {\em cost\/} ''
                 parameters are kept. {\em Risk\/} measures the danger
                 to the patient from no risk such as taking a blood
                 pressure to highly invasive proceedings such as a liver
                 biopsy. {\em Time\/} measures whether results can be
                 expected in minutes, hours, or days. {\em Money\/}
                 measures the actual cost to the patient FD-Equivalents
                 stores the synonyms and antonyms of each feature. These
                 are used to translate between knowledge bases using
                 different terminology. \par

                 Features were first classified in terms of a Problem
                 Oriented Medical Record. We have added an anatomical
                 reclassification in terms of body systems. Experts will
                 be able to add new kinds of feature classifications.
                 \par

                 MEDAS, a multi-membership Bayesian model, needs binary
                 representations for its inference. These Binary
                 Features are created by the expert physician in the
                 given disorder patterns. For example, ``WBC 50,000'',
                 or ``Age 2 Female Hematocrit 42'' are binary features
                 that might appear in a disorder pattern. Laboratory
                 results often lead to a multiplicity of binary features
                 (such as ``WBC 3,000'', or 3,000 WBC 10,000, etc.). Our
                 design allows the user to enter the value of such a
                 feature and have the system set of all the
                 corresponding binary features. This intelligent user
                 interface is controlled by a grammar that allows us to
                 parse the binary features and generate rules for them.
                 \par

                 The knowledge base for a particular problem domain such
                 as OB/GYN is organized as a collection of disorder
                 patterns. Each of these is represented as a list of
                 binary features and associated probabilities. The
                 domain knowledge base contains only the features
                 relevant to that domain. \par

                 Experience with the Feature Dictionary has convinced us
                 that there are many advantages in using a DBMS to store
                 the knowledge base for an expert system. The TOOL BOX,
                 originally in ACCENT-R, was rewritten in dBase III for
                 the PC. The knowledge bases created on the PC were then
                 ported to the mainframe. As the number of domains
                 supported by MEDAS grew, it became evident that we
                 needed a DBMS that could function in both environments
                 so we are in the process of converting to ORACLE.",

                 hereafter) is a set of rules that have both positive
                 and negative subgoals. It is common to view a deductive
                 database as a general logic program consisting of rules
                 (IDB) sitting above elementary relations (EDB, facts).
                 It is desirable to associate one Herbrand model with a
                 program and think of that model as the ``meaning of the
                 program,'' or its ``declarative semantics.'' Ideally,
                 queries directed to the program would be answered in
                 accordance with this model. We introduce {\em unfounded
                 sets\/} and {\em well-founded partial models}, and
                 define the well-founded semantics of a program to be
                 its well-founded partial model. If the well-founded
                 partial model is in fact a model, we call it the {\em
                 well-founded\/} model, and say the program is
                 ``well-behaved''. We show that the class of
                 well-behaved programs properly includes previously
                 studied classes of ``stratified'' and ``locally
                 stratified'' programs Gelfand and Lifschits have
                 proposed a definition of ``unique stable model'' for
                 general logic programs. We show that a program has a
                 unique stable model if it has a well-founded model, in
                 which case they are the same. We discuss why the
                 converse is not true.",

                 focuses on allowing updates in logic programs. In this
                 paper we propose a language DatalogA which is an
                 extension of Datalog with updates to base relations. We
                 define some procedural constructs to allow update
                 programs to be written in an easy manner. The (W,p)
                 scheme of Dynamic Logic fits nicely into the semantics
                 of DatalogA programs in which W is taken to be the set
                 of all possible states of the program and p is the
                 accessibility relation between states. We give
                 declarative semantics and equivalent constructed model
                 semantics for DatalogA programs. We show that in the
                 absence of updates our semantics reduce to the
                 classical semantics of Datalog. Finally, we show some

  abstract =     "In this paper we discuss the optimization of
                 multiple-relation multiple-disjunct queries in a
                 relational database system. Since optimization
                 techniques for conjunctive (single disjunct) queries in
                 relational databases are well known [Smith75, Wong76,
                 Selinger79, Yao79, Youssefi79], the natural way to
                 evaluate a multiple-disjunct query was to execute each
                 disjunct independently [Bernstein81, Kerschberg82]
                 However, evaluating each disjunct independently may be
                 very inefficient. In this paper, we develop methods
                 that merge two or more disjuncts to form a term. The
                 advantage of merging disjuncts to form terms lies in
                 the fact that each term can be evaluated with a single
                 scan of each relation that is present in the term. In
                 addition, the number of times a join is performed will
                 also be reduced when two or more disjuncts are merged.
                 The criteria for merging a set of disjuncts will be
                 presented. As we will see, the number of times each
                 relation in the query is scanned will be equal to the
                 number of terms. Thus, minimizing the number of terms
                 will minimize the number of scans for each relation. We
                 will formulate the problem of minimizing the number of
                 scans as one of covering a merge graph by a minimum
                 number of complete merge graphs which are a restricted
                 class of Cartesian product graphs. In general, the
                 problem of minimizing the number of scans is
                 NP-complete. We present polynomial time algorithms for
                 special classes of merge graphs. We also present a
                 heuristic for general merge graphs. \par

                 Throughout this paper, we will assume that no relations
                 have any indices on them and that we are only concerned
                 with reducing the number of scans for each relation
                 present in the query. What about relations that have
                 indices on them? It turns out that our performance
                 metric of reducing the number of scans is beneficial
                 even in the case that there are indices. In
                 [Muralikrishna88] we demonstrate that when optimizing
                 single-relation multiple-disjunct queries, the cost
                 (measured in terms of disk accesses) may be reduced if
                 all the disjuncts are optimized together rather than
                 individually. Thus, our algorithm for minimizing the
                 number of terms is also very beneficial in cases where
                 indices exist",

                 in the database. Several methods are possible for
                 processing queries that retrieve the value returned by
                 a database procedure. The conventional algorithm is to
                 execute the queries in a procedure whenever it is
                 accessed. A second strategy requires caching the
                 previous value returned by the database procedure. If
                 the cached value is valid at the time of a query, the
                 value is returned immediately. If the cached value has
                 been invalidated by an update, the value is recomputed,
                 stored back into the cache, and then returned. A third
                 strategy uses a differential view maintenance algorithm
                 to maintain an up-to-date copy of the value returned by
                 the procedure. This paper compares the performance of

  abstract =     "The by now conventional perspective on databases,
                 especially deductive databases, is that they are sets
                 of first order sentences. As such, they can be said to
                 be claims about the truths of some {\em external\/}
                 world, the database is a symbolic representation of
                 that world. \par

                 While agreeing with this account of what a database is,
                 I disagree with how, both in theory and practice, a
                 database is {\em used}, specifically how it is queried
                 and how its integrity is enforced. \par

                 Virtually all approaches to database query evaluation
                 treat queries as first order formulas, usually with
                 free variables whose bindings resulting from the
                 evaluation phase define the answers to the query. The
                 sole exception to this is the work of Levesque (1981,
                 1984), who argues that queries should be formulas in an
                 epistemic modal logic. Queries, in other words, should
                 be permitted to address aspects of the external world
                 as represented in the database, as well as aspects of
                 the database itself i.e., aspects of what the database
                 {\em knows}. To take a simple example, suppose {\em DB
                 = p y q\/} \par

                 Query $p$ (i.e., is $p$ true in the external world?)
                 \par

                 Answer unknown \par

                 Query {\em Kp\/} (i e. do you know whether $p$ is true
                 in the external world?) \par

                 Answer no \par

                 Levesque's modal logic (called KFOPCE) distinguishes
                 between known and unknown individuals in the database
                 and thus accounts for ``regular'' database values as
                 well as null values. For example, if {\em KB\/} is
                 \par

                 {Teach (John, Math100), ($x$) Teach ({\em x}, CS100),
                 Teach (Mary, Psych100) y Teach (Sue, Psych100)},
                 \par

                 then \par

                 Query ($x$) {$K$} Teach (John, $x$) i.e., is there a
                 known course which John teaches? \par

                 Answer yes-Math100 \par

                 Query ($x$) {$K$} Teach ({\em x}, CS100) i e is there a
                 known teacher for CS100? \par

                 Answer No \par

                 Query ($x$) Teach ({\em x}, Psych100) i.e., does anyone
                 teach Psych 100? \par

                 Answer: Yes - Mary or Sue \par

                 Query ($x$) {$K$} Teach ({\em x}, Psych100) i.e., is
                 there a known teacher of Psych100? \par

                 Answer No \par

                 Levesque (1981, 1984) provides a semantics for his
                 language KFOPCE FOPCE, is the first order language
                 KFOPCE without the modal K Levesque proposes that a
                 database is best viewed as a set of FOPCE sentences,
                 and that it be queried by sentences of KFOPCE. He
                 further provides a (noneffective) way of answering
                 database queries. \par

                 Recently I have considered the concept of a static
                 integrity constraint in the context of Levesque's
                 KFOPCE (Reiter 1988). The conventional view of
                 integrity constraints is that, like the database
                 itself, they too are first order formulas (e.g., Lloyd
                 Topor (1985), Nicolas Yazdanian (1978), Reiter (1984)).
                 There are two definitions in the literature of a
                 deductive database {\em KB\/} satisfying an integrity
                 constraint {\em IC}. \par

                 {\em Definition 1\/} Consistency (e.g., Kowalski
                 (1978), Sadri and Kowalski (1987)) {\em KB satisfies IC
                 if f KB + IC is satisfiable\/} \par

                 {\em Definition 2\/} Entailment (e.g., Lloyd and Topor
                 (1985), Reiter (1984)) {\em KB satisfies IC if f KB
                 @@@@ IC\/} \par

                 Alas, neither definition seems correct. Consider a
                 constraint requiring that employees have social
                 security numbers (V $x$) {\em emp\/} ($x$ ) ($y$) {\em
                 ss\#\/} ({\em x y\/}) (1) \par

                 1 Suppose {\em KB\/} = {emp (Mary)} Then {\em KB +
                 IC\/} is satisfiable. But intuitively, we want the
                 constraint to require {\em KB\/} to contain a ss\#
                 ent",

                 of correctness is called {\em serializability}.
                 Serializability has proven to be a highly useful
                 concept for transaction systems for data-processing
                 style applications. Recent interest in applying
                 database concepts to applications in computer-aided
                 design, office information systems, etc. has resulted
                 in transactions of relatively long duration. For such
                 transactions, there are serious consequences to
                 requiring serializability as the notion of correctness.
                 Specifically, such systems either impose long-duration
                 waits or require the abortion of long transactions. In
                 this paper, we define a transaction model that allows
                 for several alternative notions of correctness without
                 the requirement of serializability. After introducing
                 the model, we investigate classes of schedules for
                 transactions. We show that these classes are richer
                 than analogous classes under the classical model.
                 Finally, we show the potential practicality of our
                 model by describing protocols that permit a transaction
                 manager to allow correct non-serializable executions",

                 The testbed consists of two layers, the knowledge
                 manager and the database management system, with the
                 former at the top. The testbed is based on the logic
                 programming paradigm, wherein data, knowledge, and
                 queries are all expressed as Horn clauses. The
                 knowledge manager compiles pure, function-free Horn
                 clause queries into embedded-SQL programs, which are
                 executed by the database management system to produce
                 the query results. The database management system is a
                 commercial relational database system and provides
                 storage for both rules and facts. First, the testbed

                 conducted using the current version of the testbed and

                 is a formally-defined production system language with

                 turn out not to be a strict subtype of this superclass.
                 A similar problem arises when an object is allowed to
                 be a member of several classes which make incompatible
                 predictions about its type. We argue that none of the
                 previous approaches suggested to deal with such
                 situations is entirely satisfactory. \par

                 A language feature is therefore presented to permit
                 class definitions which contradict aspects of other
                 classes, such as superclasses, in an object-based
                 language. In essence, the approach requires
                 contradictions among class definitions to be {\em
                 explicitly\/} acknowledged. We define a semantics of
                 the resulting language, which restores the condition
                 that subclasses are both subsets and subtypes, and
                 deals correctly with the case when an object can belong
                 to several classes. This is done by separating the
                 notions of ``class'' and ``type'', and it allows query
                 compilers to detect type errors as well as eliminate
                 some run-time checks in queries, even in the presence
                 of ``contradictory'' class definitions.",

  abstract =     "We introduce and describe the {\em alternating
                 fixpoint\/} of a logic program with negation. The
                 underlying idea is to monotonically build up a set of
                 {\em negative\/} conclusions until the least fixpoint
                 is reached, using a transformation related to the one
                 that defines stable models, developed by Gelfand and
                 Lifschitz. From a fixed set of negative conclusions, we
                 can derive the positive conclusions that follow
                 (without deriving any further negative ones), by
                 traditional Horn clause semantics. The union of
                 positive and negative conclusions is called the {\em
                 alternating fixpoint partial model}. The name
                 ``alternating'' was chosen because the transformation
                 runs in two passes; the first pass transforms an
                 underestimate of the set of negative conclusions into
                 an (intermediate) overestimate; the second pass
                 transforms the overestimates into a new underestimate;
                 the composition of the two passes is monotonic.
                 \par

                 Our main theorem is that the alternating fixpoint
                 partial model is exactly the well-founded partial
                 model. \par

                 We also show that a system is {\em fixpoint logic},
                 which permits rule bodies to be first order formulas
                 but requires inductive relations to be positive within
                 them, can be transformed straightforwardly into a
                 normal logic program whose alternating fixpoint partial
                 model corresponds to the least fixpoint of the fixpoint
                 logic system. Thus alternating fixpoint logic is at
                 least as expressive as fixpoint logic. The converse is
                 shown to hold for finite structures.",

                 more general and appropriate for database applications.
                 In particular, a function that selects a field of a

                 database the data complexity of conjunctive queries
                 grows from PTIME into CoNP with some simple examples of
                 CoNP-Complete conjunctive queries. A natural question
                 which arises in this context is whether it is possible
                 to syntactically characterize those queries which are
                 ``bad'' (i.e., CoNP-Complete) from those that are
                 ``good'' (i.e., with PTIME data complexity) given a
                 predefined ``pattern'' of disjunctions in the database.
                 In this paper, we study the data complexity of
                 conjunctive queries. We give a complete syntactic
                 characterization of CoNP-Complete conjunctive queries
                 for a class of disjunctive databases called
                 OR-Databases. Our results can be used in complexity
                 tailored design where design decisions are motivated by
                 complexity of query processing. Also, we establish that
                 a similar complete syntactic characterization for
                 disjunctive queries, with negation allowed only on base
                 predicates, would answer the open problem ``Does Graph

                 description of objects not only in terms of their
                 relations to other known objects, but in terms of a
                 level of intensional structure as well. The CLASSIC
                 language of {\em structured descriptions\/} permits (i)
                 partial descriptions of individuals, under an `open
                 world' assumption, (ii) answers to queries either as
                 extensional lists of values or as descriptions that
                 necessarily hold of all possible answers, and (iii) an
                 easily extensible schema, which can be accessed
                 uniformly with the data. One of the strengths of the
                 approach is that the same language plays multiple roles
                 in the processes of defining and populating the DB, as
                 well as querying and answering. \par

                 CLASSIC (for which we have a prototype main-memory
                 implementation) can actively discover new information
                 about objects from several sources: it can recognize
                 new classes under which an object falls based on a
                 description of the object, it can propagate some
                 deductive consequences of DB updates, it has simple
                 procedural recognizers, and it supports a limited form
                 of forward-chaining rules to derive new conclusions
                 about known objects. \par

                 The kind of language of descriptions and queries
                 presented here provides a new arena for the search for
                 languages that are more expressive than conventional
                 DBMS languages, but for which query processing is still
                 tractable. This space of languages differs from the
                 subsets of predicate calculus hitherto explored by
                 deductive databases.",

                 iteratively samples from input relations, and evaluates
                 the associated estimators developed in our previous
                 work, until a stopping criterion (e.g., a time quota or
                 a desired error range) is satisfied. \par

                 iteration (so that the time quota will not be

  abstract =     "Interactive use of relational database management
                 systems (DBMS) requires a user to be knowledgeable
                 about the semantics of the application represented in
                 the database. In many cases, however, users are not
                 trained in the application field and are not DBMS
                 experts. Two categories of functionality are
                 problematic for such users: (1) updating a database
                 without violating integrity constraints imposed by the
                 domain and (2) using join operations to retrieve data
                 from more than one relation. We have been conducting
                 research to help an uninformed or casual user interact
                 with a relational DBMS. \par

                 This paper describes two capabilities to aid an
                 interactive database user who is neither an application
                 specialist nor a DBMS expert. We have developed
                 deferred Referential Integrity Checking (RIC) and
                 Intelligent Join (IJ) which extend the operations of a
                 relational DBMS. These facilities are made possible by
                 explicit representation of database semantics combined
                 with a relational schema. Deferred RIC is a static
                 validation procedure that checks uniqueness of tuples,
                 non-null keys, uniqueness of keys, and inclusion
                 dependencies. IJ allows a user to identify only the
                 ``target'' data which is to be retrieved without the
                 need to additionally specify ``join clauses''. In this
                 paper we present the motivation for these facilities,
                 describe the features of each, and present examples of
                 their use.",

                 recovery from media failures in database systems. Both
                 techniques achieve high availability by having two
                 copies of all data and indexes, so that recovery is
                 immediate. ``Mirrored declustering'' spreads two copies
                 of each relation across two identical sets of disks.
                 ``Interleaved declustering'' spreads two copies of each
                 relation across one set of disks while keeping both
                 copies of each tuple on separate disks. Both techniques
                 pay the same costs of doubling storage requirements and
                 requiring updates to be applied to both copies}.
                 \par

                 {\em Mirroring offers greater simplicity and
                 universality. Recovery can be implemented at lower
                 levels of the system software (e.g., the disk
                 controller). For architectures that do not share disks
                 globally, it allows global and local cluster indexes to
                 be independent. Also, mirroring does not require data
                 to be declustered (i.e., spread over multiple disks)}.

                 {\em Interleaved declustering offers significant
                 improvements in recovery time, mean time to loss of
                 both copies of some data, throughput during normal
                 operation, and response time during recovery. For all
                 architectures, interleaved declustering enables data to
                 be spread over twice as many disks for improved load
                 balancing. We show how tuning for interleaved
                 declustering is simplified because it is dependent only
                 on a few parameters that are usually well known for a
                 specific workload and system configuration}.",

                 effect of parallelism on concurrency control
                 performance has received little attention. This paper
                 examines the interplay between parallelism and

                 concurrency control. Issues addressed include how
                 performance scales as a function of machine size and
                 the degree to which partitioning the database for
                 intra-transaction parallelism improves performance for

                 several perspectives, including response time,
                 throughput, and speedup, and we do so over a fairly
                 wide range of system loads. We also examine the

                 prime and testing if a schema is in normal form.
                 Algorithms for these problems are needed in database
                 design tools. The problems can be solved by trivial
                 exponential algorithms. Although the size of the

                 and hence is fairly small, such exponential algorithms
                 are not usable for all design tasks. We give algorithms

                 approaches to modeling sets are articulated and
                 compared. The class of {\em regular\/} OODB schemas
                 supports the explicit representation of set-valued
                 types. Using an {\em object-based\/} semantics for
                 sets, the regular schemas correspond to most
                 implemented OODB systems in the literature; a {\em
                 value-based\/} semantics for sets is also introduced.
                 Without restrictions, both of these approaches support
                 the specification of all computable queries. Assuming
                 that the new operator is prohibited, the query language
                 of the regular OODB schemas under the object-based
                 semantics is complete in PSPACE; and under the
                 value-based semantics it has hyper-exponential
                 complexity. The third approach to modeling sets is
                 given by the {\em algebraic OODB\/} model, in which
                 multi-valued attributes rather than set-valued types
                 are supported. method implementations can use operators
                 stemming from the relational algebra, and do not have
                 side-effects. The query language of algebraic OODBs is
                 more powerful than the relational algebra but has
                 complexity bounded by PTIME. The expressive power and
                 complexity of data access for other variations of OODBs
                 are also considered. Finally, a new relational query
                 language, called {\em algebra\/} + {\em pointwise
                 recursion}, is introduced. This is equivalent to the
                 algebraic OODB language, and can compute generalized
                 transitive closure.",

                 models: cyclicity is allowed in both its schemas and
                 instances. Our main contribution is the operational
                 part of the data model, the query language IQL, which

                 set of answers. We study here the safety problem for

                 for detecting such opportunities is to reduce the
                 question to one of conjunctive-query containment. A
                 more powerful technique is to test whether one

                 have attracted much attention. One thing common to
                 these problems is their demand to quickly solve the
                 implication problem -- given two predicates {$Q$} and
                 ??, can {$Q$} imply ({$Q$})? The implication problem
                 has been solved by converting it into a satisfiability
                 problem. Based on a graph representation, a detailed
                 study of the general implication problem on its own is
                 presented in this paper. We proved that the general
                 implication problem, in which all six comparison
                 operators: =, , , , , , as well as conjunctions and

                 and disjunctions are studied. Our theoretical results
                 show that for some special cases the polynomial
                 complexity algorithm can solve the implication problem
                 which allows the ``'' operator or disjunctions in the
                 predicates. Necessary conditions for detecting when the
                 ``'' operator and disjunctions are allowed are also

                 with the issues of program-classification, and
                 parallelization-strategies. We propose five
                 parallelization strategies that differ based on the

                 of communication and synchronization among processors,
                 and the programs to which they are applicable. In
                 particular, we start our study with
                 pure-parallelization, i.e., parallelization without

                 the set of rules defined by the user is {\em
                 consistent}, i.e., that no contradictory facts can be
                 inferred by the rules. In this paper, we address the
                 problem of resolving conflicts of rules that assign
                 values to virtual attributes. We devise a general
                 framework for the study of the problem, and we propose
                 an approach that subsumes all previously suggested
                 solutions. Moreover, it suggests several additional
                 solutions, which very often capture the semantics of
                 the data more accurately than the known approaches.
                 Finally, we address the issue of how to index rules so
                 that conflicts are resolved efficiently, i.e., only one
                 of the applicable rules is processed at query time.",

                 one which automatically executes specified actions when
                 specified conditions arise. HiPAC has proposed
                 Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules as a formalism for

  abstract =     "Access methods for multidimensional data have
                 attracted much research interest in recent years. In
                 general, the data structures proposed for this problem
                 partition the database into a set of disk pages
                 (buckets). Access to the buckets is provided by
                 searching a directory of some type such as a tree
                 directory or inverted index or by computation of a
                 multiattribute hash function. Examples of the first
                 approach are Multidimensional B-trees[Sch82], K-D-B
                 trees[Rob81] (see also [Sam84] for a survey of these
                 methods) whereas multiattribute hashing methods are
                 described for example in [Rot74],[Aho79],[Riv76] and
                 [Ram83]. In addition, there are also hybrid methods
                 which combine hashing with a directory of some type
                 [Ore84],[Nie84], [Fag79]. \par

                 In all the work mentioned above, the performance is
                 measured in terms of the number of disk accesses made
                 to retrieve the answer without distinguishing whether
                 these are sequential or random. We argue that
                 performance measurements must consider this factor in
                 order to be realistic, especially in the single user
                 environment. Some evidence to support this claim is
                 given in [Sal88, pg. 22] with the IBM 3380 disk drive
                 as an example. For this type of disk, a comparison
                 between accessing $m$ blocks randomly and accessing a
                 contiguous cluster of $m$ blocks is made. The results
                 show that for $m$ = 10, the random access is slower by
                 a factor of about 8 than the clustered one whereas for
                 $m$ = 100 it is slower by a factor of 25. \par

                 Another motivation for this work are optical disks. In
                 this case, there is a big advantage in clustering since
                 the access mechanism on many of these drives is
                 equipped with an adjustable mirror which allows slight
                 deflections of the laser beam. This means that it may
                 be possible to read a complete cluster from a sequence
                 of adjacent tracks beneath the head with a single
                 random seek [Chri88]. \par

                 Our work is inspired by an interesting recent paper
                 [Fal86] which proposes to organize the physical layout
                 of a multiattribute hash file by encoding record
                 signatures using gray code rather than simple binary
                 code. In this way neighboring buckets contain records
                 which differ on a single bit in their signatures. It is
                 then proved that the records which form the answer to a
                 partial match query will tend to be contained in a
                 smaller number of clusters as compared with the binary
                 arrangement. It is also shown that this idea is
                 applicable to many other multiattribute hashing schemes
                 with a small amount of overhead. In addition, it can
                 improve access time to directories of grid type files,
                 extendible hashing and file methods which employ the
                 z-ordering [Ore84].",

                 Until now, the only analytical aid to the determination
                 of a B-tree's utilization has been the analysis by Yao
                 and related work. Yao showed that the utilization of
                 B-tree nodes under pure inserts was 69%. We derive
                 analytically and verify by simulation the utilization
                 of B-tree nodes constructed from $n$ inserts followed
                 by $M$ modifies (where $M ? N$), where each modify is a
                 delete followed by an insert. Assuming that nodes only
                 merge when they are empty (the technique used in most
                 database management systems), we show that the
                 utilization is 39% as M becomes large. We extend this
                 model to a parameterized mixture of inserts and
                 modifies. Surprisingly, if the modifies are mixed with
                 just 10% inserts, then the utilization is over 62%. We
                 also calculated the probability of splitting and
                 merging. We derive a simple rule-of-thumb that
                 accurately calculates the probability of splitting. We
                 present two models for computing this utilization, the

                 supports traversal recursion over large, acyclic
                 graphs. The nodes of the graph are sorted in
                 topological order and stored in a B-tree. Hence,
                 traversal of the graph can be done in a single scan.
                 Nodes and edges can also be inserted, deleted, and
                 modified efficiently.",

                 Cartesian product file on multiple disks to maximize
                 the parallelism for partial match queries. Cartesian
                 product files appear as a result of some secondary key
                 access methods, such as the multiattribute hashing
                 [10], the grid file [6] etc.. For the binary case, the
                 problem is reduced into grouping the 2 $n$ binary
                 strings on $n$ bits in $m$ groups of unsimilar strings.
                 The main idea proposed in this paper is to group the
                 strings such that the group forms an Error Correcting
                 Code (ECC). This construction guarantees that the

                 distances, i.e., they will differ in many bit
                 positions. Intuitively, this should result into good
                 declustering. We briefly mention previous heuristics
                 for declustering, we describe how exactly to build a
                 declustering scheme using an ECC, and we prove a

                 to be optimal. Analytical results show that our method
                 is superior to older heuristics, and that it is very
                 close to the theoretical (non-tight) bound.",

                 concurrency control and recovery for transaction
                 systems interact in subtle ways. In most theoretical
                 work, however, concurrency control and recovery are
                 treated as separate, largely independent problems. In
                 this paper we investigate the interactions between
                 concurrency control and recovery. We consider two
                 general recovery methods for abstract data types,
                 update-in-place and deferred-update. While each
                 requires operations to conflict if they do not
                 ``commute,'' the two recovery methods require subtly
                 different notions of commutativity. We give a precise
                 characterization of the conflict relations that work
                 with each recovery method, and show that each permits
                 conflict relations that the other does not. Thus, the
                 two recovery methods place incomparable constraints on
                 concurrency control. Our analysis applies to arbitrary
                 abstract data types, including those with operations

  abstract =     "This paper examines an extension of Horn logic in
                 which rules can add entries to a database
                 hypothetically. Several researchers have developed
                 logical systems along these lines, but the complexity
                 and expressibility of such logics is only now being
                 explored. It has been shown, for instance, that the
                 data-complexity of these logics is {\em PSPACE\/}
                 -complete in the function-free, predicate case. This
                 paper extends this line of research by developing
                 syntactic restrictions with lower complexity. These
                 restrictions are based on two ideas from Horn-clause
                 logic: {\em linear recursion\/} and {\em stratified
                 negation}. In particular, a notion of stratification is
                 developed in which negation-as-failure alternates with
                 linear recursion. The complexity of such rulebases
                 depends on the number of layers of stratification. The
                 result is a hierarchy of syntactic classes which
                 corresponds exactly in the polynomial-time hierarchy of
                 complexity classes. In particular, rulebases with $k$
                 strata are data-complete for {$P$} $h$ . Furthermore,
                 these rulebases provide a complete characterization of
                 the relational queries in {$P$} $h$ . That is, any
                 query whose graph is in {$P$} $h$ can be represented as
                 a set of hypothetical rules with $k$ strata. Unlike
                 other expressibility results in the literature, this
                 result does not require the data domain to be linearly
                 ordered.",

                 arbitrarily bad. This leads to poor performance and
                 highly inaccurate responses to spatial queries. The
                 situation can be improved by storing some objects in
                 the index redundantly. Most spatial indexes permit no
                 flexibility in adjusting the amount of redundancy.
                 Spatial indexes based on z-order permit this
                 flexibility. Accuracy of the query response increases
                 with redundancy, (there is a ``diminishing return''
                 effect). Search time, as measured by disk accesses
                 first decreases and then increases with redundancy.
                 There is, therefore, an optimal amount of redundancy
                 (for a given data set). The optimal use of redundancy
                 for z-order is explored through analysis of the z-order

                 recursive queries, we are investigating a graphical
                 query language called {$G$} +, which allows, among
                 other things, easy formulation of certain queries
                 involving simple paths in directed graphs. This led us
                 to study whether such queries are expressible in
                 DATALOG, the language of function-free Horn clauses.
                 Since some {$G$} + queries are NP-hard, and all DATALOG
                 queries are polynomial time computable, the answer
                 appears to be negative. However, it would be

                 settling such questions with certainty. The objective
                 of this paper is the development of one such tool, {\em

                 DATALOG programs derived here, and its relationship to

                 technology over the past decade has brought it to the
                 point where it is beginning to compete directly with
                 magnetic disc technology. WORM optical discs in
                 particular, which permanently register information on
                 the disc surface, have significant advantages over
                 magnetic technology for applications that are mainly
                 archival in nature but require the ability to do
                 frequent on-line insertions. \par

                 In this paper, we propose a class of access methods
                 that use rewritable storage for the temporary buffering
                 of insertions to data sets stored on WORM optical discs
                 and we examine the relationship between the retrieval
                 performance from WORM optical discs and the utilization
                 of disc storage space when one of these organizations
                 is employed. We describe the performance trade off as
                 one of fast sequential retrieval of the contents of a
                 block versus wasted space owing to data replication. A
                 model of a specific instance of such an organization (a
                 buffered hash file scheme) is described that allows for
                 the specification of retrieval performance objectives.
                 Alternative strategies for managing data replication
                 that allow trade offs between higher consumption rates
                 and better average retrieval performance are also
                 described. We then provide an expected value analysis
                 of the amount of disc space that must be consumed on a
                 WORM disc to meet specified performance limits. The
                 analysis is general enough to allow easy extension to
                 other types of buffered files systems for WORM optical
                 discs.",

                 timestamped database with a non-deletion policy.
                 Historical data (superceded versions) is stored
                 separately from current data. Our access method is
                 called the {\em Time-Split B-tree}. It is an index
                 structure based on Malcolm Easton's Write Once B-tree.
                 \par

                 The Write Once B-tree was developed for data stored
                 entirely on a Write-Once Read-Many or {\em WORM\/}
                 optical disk. The Time-Split B-tree differs from the
                 Write Once B-tree in the following ways: \par

                 Current data {\em must\/} be stored on an {\em
                 erasable\/} random-access device. \par

                 Historical data {\em may\/} be stored on {\em any\/}
                 random-access device, including WORMs, erasable optical
                 disks, and magnetic disks. The point is to use a faster
                 and more expensive device for the current data and a
                 slower cheaper device for the historical data. \par

                 The splitting policies have been changed to reduce
                 redundancy in the structure--the option of pure key
                 splits as in B + -trees and a choice of split times for
                 time-based splits enable this performance enhancement.
                 \par

                 When data is migrated from the current to the
                 historical database, it is consolidated and appended to
                 the end of the historical database, allowing for high
                 space utilization in WORM disk sectors. \par

                 data to eliminate some of the functional joins that

                 refer to our technique for replicating data as {\em

                 between objects. An important semantic relationship

                 set of objects related by the IS-PART-OF relationship
                 is collectively called a composite object. \par

                 An earlier paper [KIM87b] presented a model of
                 composite objects which has been implemented in the
                 ORION object-oriented database system at MCC. Although
                 the composite-object feature has been found quite
                 useful, the model suffers from a number of serious
                 shortcomings, primarily because it overloads a number
                 of orthogonal semantics on the references. In this
                 paper, first we present a more general model of
                 composite objects which does not suffer from these
                 shortcomings. Further, [KIM87b] made an important
                 contribution by exploring the use of composite objects
                 as a unit for versions, physical clustering, and
                 concurrency control. The extended model of composite
                 objects necessitates non-trivial changes to the results
                 of [KIM87b]. This paper describes the new results on

                 additional semantics to obtain more effective object
                 buffering and clustering. We use the information
                 collected from real-world object-oriented applications,
                 the Berkeley CAD Group's OCT design tools, as the basis
                 for a simulation model with which to investigate
                 alternative buffering and clustering strategies.
                 Observing from our measurements that real CAD
                 applications exhibit high data read to write ratios, we
                 propose a run-time clustering algorithm whose initial
                 evaluation indicates that system response time can be
                 improved by a factor of 200% when the read/write ratio
                 is high. We have also found it useful to limit the
                 amount of I/O allowed to the clustering algorithm as it
                 examines candidate pages for clustering at run-time.
                 Basically, there is little performance distinction
                 between limiting reclustering to a few I/Os or many, so
                 a low limit on I/O appears to be acceptable. We also

                 proposed by Krishnamurthy et al. We also study the
                 combination of these heuristics with two general
                 combinatorial optimization techniques, iterative
                 improvement and simulated annealing, that were studied
                 in a previous paper. Several interesting combinations
                 are experimentally compared. For completeness, we also
                 include simple iterative improvement and simulated
                 annealing in our experimental comparisons. We find that
                 two combinations of the augmentation heuristic and
                 iterative improvement perform the best under most
                 conditions. The results are validated using two
                 different cost models and several different synthetic
                 benchmarks.",

                 use a DBMS. Each kind of application poses new
                 requirements for the DBMS. The Starburst project at
                 IBM's Almaden Research Center aims to extend relational
                 DBMS technology to bridge this gap between applications
                 and the DBMS. While providing a full function
                 relational system to enable sharing across
                 applications, Starburst will also allow (sophisticated)
                 programmers to add many kinds of extensions to the base
                 system's capabilities, including language extensions
                 (e.g., new datatypes and operations), data management
                 extensions (e.g., new access and storage methods) and
                 internal processing extensions (e.g., new join methods

                 features, the database query language processor must be
                 very powerful and highly extensible. Starburst's
                 language processor features a powerful query language,
                 rule-based optimization and query rewrite, and an
                 execution system based on an extended relational
                 algebra. In this paper, we describe the design of

                 pessimistic scheme\/} maintains availability and
                 consistency of replicated data by ensuring that updates
                 occur in at most one group. A pessimistic scheme is
                 called a {\em static scheme\/} if these {\em
                 distinguished\/} groups are determined only by the
                 membership of different groups in the partitioned

                 that is more powerful than voting. In this scheme, the
                 set of distinguished groups, called an {\em acceptance
                 set}, is chosen at design time. To commit an update, a

                 formulated as a {\em sparse 0-1 linear programming

                 handled using the very rich class of existing
                 techniques for solving such problems. Based on our

                 that entity-based data management systems which support
                 class hierarchies, such as semantic data models and
                 object-oriented dbms, should not be confined to have ``

                 support two or more users engaged in a common task, and
                 that provide an interface to a shared environment.
                 These systems frequently require fine-granularity
                 sharing of data and fast response times. This paper
                 distinguishes real-time groupware systems from other
                 multi-user systems and discusses their concurrency
                 control requirements. An algorithm for concurrency
                 control in real-time groupware systems is then
                 presented. The advantages of this algorithm are its
                 simplicity of use and its responsiveness: users can
                 operate directly on the data without obtaining locks.
                 The algorithm must know some semantics of the
                 operations. However the algorithm's overall structure
                 is independent of the semantic information, allowing
                 the algorithm to be adapted to many situations. An
                 example application of the algorithm to group text
                 editing is given, along with a sketch of its proof of
                 correctness in this particular case. We note that the

                 components: version control and concurrency control.
                 This permits modular development of multiversion
                 protocols, and simplifies the task of proving the
                 correctness of these protocols. An interesting feature
                 of our framework is that the execution of read-only
                 transactions becomes completely independent of the
                 underlying concurrency control implementation. Also,
                 algorithms with the version control mechanism have
                 several advantages over most other multiversion
                 algorithms.",

                 coverage, scarce attention has been paid to the issue
                 of {\em correctness\/} for such representations.
                 Several mappings have been proposed for the
                 representation of both ER and extended ER (EER)
                 structures by relational schemas. The informal nature
                 of most of these proposals, however, does not allow a
                 precise evaluation of their correctness, nor a
                 comparison of the various mappings. We propose a {\em
                 canonical\/} relational representation for EER
                 structures and prove its correctness. We claim that a
                 relational schema represents correctly an EER structure
                 if it has {\em equivalent\/} information-capacity with
                 the corresponding canonical representation. \par

                 The second problem addressed by this paper is the
                 normalization of relational schemas that represent EER
                 structures. We examine the conditions required by this
                 process and show that ignoring these conditions leads
                 to erroneous analyses and inappropriate design
                 decisions. We show that, under these conditions, the
                 canonical relational representation of any
                 (unrestricted) EER structure has an
                 (information-capacity) equivalent {\em Boyce-Codd

                 the convenient manipulation of text. It is even more
                 difficult to use them if the text language is not based
                 on the Roman alphabet. The Arabic language is a very
                 good example of this case. Many projects have attempted
                 to use conventional database systems for Arabic data
                 manipulation (including text data), but because of
                 Arabic's many differences with English, these projects
                 have met with limited success. In the Bayan project,
                 the approach has been different. Instead of simply
                 trying to adopt an environment to Arabic, the
                 properties of the Arabic language were the starting
                 point and everything was designed to meet the needs of
                 Arabic, thus avoiding the shortcomings of other
                 projects. A text database management system was
                 designed to overcome the shortcomings of conventional
                 database management systems in manipulating text data.
                 Bayan's data model is based on an object-oriented
                 approach which helps the extensibility of the system
                 for future use. In Bayan, we designed the database with
                 the Arabic text properties in mind. We designed it to
                 support the way Arabic words are derived, classified,
                 and constructed. Furthermore, linguistic algorithms
                 (for word generation and morphological decomposition of
                 words) were designed, leading to a formalization of
                 rules of Arabic language writing and sentence
                 construction. A user interface was designed on top of
                 this environment. A new representation of the Arabic
                 characters was designed, a complete Arabic keyboard
                 layout was created, and a window-based Arabic user
                 interface was also designed.",

  abstract =     "A simple model, called a VDAG, is proposed for
                 representing hierarchically specified design data in
                 CAD database systems where there are to be alternate
                 expansions of hierarchically specified modules. The
                 model uses an ancestor-based expansion scheme to
                 control which instances of submodules are to be placed
                 within each instance of a given module. The approach is
                 aimed at reducing storage space in engineering design
                 database systems, and providing a means for designers
                 to specify alternate expansions of a module. \par

                 The expressive power of the VDAG model is investigated,
                 and the set of design forests which are VDAG-generable
                 is characterized. The problem of determining whether a
                 given design forest is VDAG-generable is shown to be
                 {\em NP\/} -complete, even when the height of the
                 forest is bounded. However, it is shown that
                 determining whether a given forest is VDAG-generable
                 and producing such a VDAG if it exists, can be
                 partitioned into a number of simpler subproblems, each
                 of which may not be too computationally difficult in
                 practice. Furthermore, for forests in a special natural
                 class that has broad applicability, a polynomial time
                 algorithm is provided that determines whether a given
                 forest is VDAG-generable, and produces such a VDAG if
                 it exists. However, we show that it is {\em NP\/} -hard
                 to produce a minimum-sized such VDAG for forests in
                 this special class, even when the height of the forest

                 secondary memory, and we wish to compute its transitive
                 closure, also storing the result in secondary memory.
                 We assume that an amount of main memory capable of
                 holding $s$ ``values'' is available, and that $s$ lies
                 between $n$, the number of nodes of the graph, and
                 $e$, the number of arcs. The cost measure we use for
                 algorithms is the {\em I/O complexity\/} of Kung and
                 Hong, where we count 1 every time a value is moved into
                 main memory from secondary memory, or vice versa.
                 \par

                 In the dense case, where $e$ is close to $n^2$, we show
                 that I/O equal to $(n^3 / s)$ is sufficient to compute
                 the transitive closure of an $n$ -node graph, using
                 main memory of size $s$. Moreover, it is necessary for
                 any algorithm that is ``standard,'' in a sense to be
                 defined precisely in the paper. Roughly, ``standard''
                 means that paths are constructed only by concatenating
                 arcs and previously discovered paths. This class
                 includes the usual algorithms that work for the
                 generalization of transitive closure to semiring
                 problems. For the sparse case, we show that I/O equal
                 to $(n^2 e / s)$ is sufficient, although the algorithm
                 we propose meets our definition of ``standard'' only if
                 the underlying graph is acyclic. We also show that
                 $(n^2 e / s)$ is necessary for any standard algorithm
                 in the sparse case. That settles the I/O complexity of
                 the sparse/acyclic case, for standard algorithms. It is
                 unknown whether this complexity can be achieved in the
                 sparse, cyclic case, by a standard algorithm, and it is
                 unknown whether the bound can be beaten by nonstandard
                 algorithms. \par

                 We then consider a special kind of standard algorithm,
                 in which paths are constructed only by concatenating
                 arcs and old paths, never by concatenating two old
                 paths. This restriction seems essential if we are to
                 take advantage of sparseness. Unfortunately, we show
                 that almost another factor of $n$ I/O is necessary.
                 That is, there is an algorithm in this class using I/O
                 $(n^3 e / s)$ for arbitrary sparse graphs, including
                 cyclic ones. Moreover, every algorithm in the
                 restricted class must use $(n^3 e / s / \log^3 n)$ I/O,
                 on some cyclic graphs.",

                 derivable facts involving an $n$ -ary predicate are
                 viewed as a set of points in the positive orthant of
                 {\em R n}. We investigate a method of deriving
                 constraints on the feasible set in the form of a
                 polyhedral convex set in the positive orthant, which we
                 call a {\em polycone}. Faces of this polycone represent
                 inequalities proven to hold among the argument sizes.
                 These inequalities are often useful for selecting an
                 evaluation method that is guaranteed to terminate for a
                 given logic procedure. The methods may be applicable to
                 other languages in which the sizes of data structures
                 can be determined syntactically. \par

                 We introduce a {\em generalized Tucker
                 representation\/} for systems of linear equations and
                 show how needed operations on polycones are performed
                 in this representation. We prove that every polycone
                 has a unique {\em normal form\/} in this
                 representation, and give an algorithm to produce it.
                 This in turn gives a decision procedure for the
                 question of whether two set of linear equations define
                 the same polycone. \par

                 When a predicate has several rules, the union of the
                 individual rule's polycones gives the set of feasible
                 argument size vectors for the predicate. Because this
                 set is not necessarily convex, we instead operate with
                 the smallest enclosing polycone, which is the closure
                 of the convex hull of the union. Retaining convexity is
                 one of the key features of our technique.
                 \par

                 Recursion is handled by finding a polycone that is a
                 fixpoint of a transformation that is derived from both
                 the recursive and nonrecursive rules. Some methods for
                 finding a fixpoint are presented, but there are many

  abstract =     "The expressive power of pure deductive database
                 languages, such as {\em DATALOG\/} and {\em stratified
                 DATALOGS}, is limited in a sense that some useful
                 queries such as functions involving {\em aggregation\/}
                 are not definable in these languages. Our concern in
                 this paper is to provide a uniform logic framework for
                 deductive databases with greater expressive power. It
                 has been shown that with a linear ordering on the
                 domain of the database, the expressive power of some
                 database languages can be enhanced so that some
                 functions involving aggregation can be defined. Yet, a
                 direct implementation of the linear ordering in
                 deductive database languages may seem unintuitive, and
                 may not be very efficient to use in practice. We
                 propose a logic for deductive databases which employs
                 the notion of ``identifying each tuple in a relation''.
                 Through the use of these {\em tuple-identifications},
                 different linear orderings are defined as a result.
                 This intuitively explains the reason why our logic has
                 greater expressive power. The proposed logic language
                 is {\em non-deterministic\/} in nature. However,
                 non-determinism is not the real reason for the enhanced
                 expressive power. A deterministic subset of the
                 programs in this language is {\em computational
                 complete\/} in the sense that it defines all the {\em
                 computable deterministic queries}. Although the problem
                 of deciding whether a program is in this subset is in
                 general undecidable, we do provide a rather general
                 sufficient test for identifying such programs. Also
                 discussed in this paper is an extended notion of
                 queries which allows both the input and the output of a
                 query to contain {\em interpreted constants\/} of an
                 infinite domain. We show that extended queries
                 involving aggregation can also be defined in the
                 language.",

                 systems as is given by the classical theory for systems

                 read/write locking algorithm for nested transactions,
                 and of an undo logging algorithm that has not

                 have developed for database systems research and
                 education. The uniform interface between operators
                 makes Volcano extensible by new operators. All
                 operators are designed and coded as if they were meant
                 for a single-process system only. When attempting to
                 parallelize Volcano, we had to choose between two
                 models of parallelization, called here the {\em
                 bracket\/} and {\em operator\/} models. We describe the
                 reasons for not choosing the bracket model, introduce
                 the novel operator model, and provide details of
                 Volcano's {\em exchange\/} operator that parallelizes
                 all other operators. It allows intra-operator
                 parallelism on partitioned datasets and both vertical
                 and horizontal inter-operator parallelism. The exchange
                 operator encapsulates all parallelism issues and
                 therefore makes implementation of parallel database
                 algorithms significantly easier and more robust.
                 Included in this encapsulation is the translation
                 between demand-driven dataflow within processes and
                 data-driven dataflow between processes. Since the
                 interface between Volcano operators is similar to the
                 one used in ``real,'' commercial systems, the
                 techniques described here can be used to parallelize

                 attention as a framework for high-performance
                 concurrency control methods. An inherent property of
                 multi-level transactions is the need for compensating
                 actions, since state-based recovery methods do no
                 longer work correctly for transaction undo. The
                 resulting requirement of operation logging adds to the
                 complexity of crash recovery. In addition, multi-level
                 recovery algorithms have to take into account that
                 high-level actions are not necessarily atomic, e.g., if
                 multiple pages are updated in a single action. \par

                 In this paper, we present a recovery algorithm for
                 multi-level transactions. Unlike typical commercial
                 database systems, we have striven for simplicity rather
                 than employing special tricks. It is important to note,
                 though, that simplicity is not achieved at the expense
                 of performance. We show how a high-performance
                 multi-level recovery algorithm can be systematically
                 developed based on few fundamental principles. The
                 presented algorithm has been implemented in the DASDBS

                 extensively studied in the database and transaction
                 processing literature, but little has been said about
                 the handling of the {\em requests\/} for transaction
                 execution in commercial TP systems, especially
                 distributed ones, managing the flow of requests is
                 often as important as executing the transactions
                 themselves. \par

                 This paper studies fault-tolerant protocols for
                 managing the flow of transaction requests between
                 clients that issue requests and servers that process
                 them. We discuss how to implement these protocols using
                 transactions and {\em recoverable queuing systems}.
                 Queuing systems are used to move requests reliably
                 between clients and servers. The protocols use queuing
                 systems to ensure that the server processes each
                 request exactly once and that a client processes each
                 reply at least once. We treat request-reply protocols
                 for single-transaction requests, for multi-transaction
                 requests, and for requests that require interaction
                 with the display after the request is submitted.",

                 stratified programs that have several attractive
                 properties. Modular stratification generalizes
                 stratification and local stratification, while allowing
                 programs that are not expressible by stratified
                 programs. For modularly stratified programs the
                 well-founded semantics coincides with the stable model
                 semantics, and makes every ground literal true or
                 false. Modularly stratified programs are all weakly
                 stratified, but the converse is false. Unlike some
                 weakly stratified programs, modularly stratified
                 programs can be evaluated in a subgoal-at-a-time
                 fashion. We demonstrate a technique for rewriting a
                 modularly stratified program for bottom-up evaluation
                 and extend this rewriting to include magic-set
                 techniques. The rewritten program, when evaluated
                 bottom-up, gives the same answers as the well-founded
                 semantics. We discuss extending modular stratification
                 to other operators such as set-grouping and aggregation

                 value {\em undefined\/} in Przymusinsi's 3-valued
                 formalization of nonmonotonic reasoning and logic
                 programming. We argue that this formalization can lead
                 to the problem of unintended semantics and loss of
                 disjunctive information. We modify the formalization by
                 proposing two general principles for logic program
                 semantics: {\em justifiability\/} and {\em minimal
                 undefinedness}. The former is shown to be a general
                 property for almost all logic program semantics, and
                 the latter requires the use of the undefined only when
                 it is necessary. We show that there are three types of
                 information embedded in the undefined: the disjunctive,
                 the factoring, and the ``difficult-to-be-assigned''. In
                 the modified formalization, the first two can be
                 successfully identified and branched into multiple
                 models. This leaves only the

                 complexity, there is genuine need to query this
                 repository of information. Moreover, since users of the

                 information that is data and information that is
                 knowledge, access to knowledge and data should be
                 provided with a single, coherent instrument. We provide
                 an informal review of various kinds of knowledge
                 queries, with possible syntax and semantics. We then
                 formalize a framework of knowledge-rich databases, and
                 a simple query language consisting of a pair of
                 retrieve and describe statements. The retrieve
                 statement is for querying the data (it corresponds to
                 the basic retrieval statement of various knowledge-rich
                 database systems). The describe statement is for
                 querying the knowledge. Essentially, it inquires about
                 the meaning of a concept under specified circumstances.
                 We provide algorithms for evaluating sound and finite

                 ``ordered logic programming'', which includes some
                 abstractions of the object-oriented paradigm, is
                 presented. An ordered program consists of a number of
                 modules (objects), where each module is composed by a
                 number of rules possibly with negated head predicates.
                 A sort of ``isa'' hierarchy can be defined among the
                 modules in order to allow for rule inheritance.
                 Therefore, every module sees its own rules as local
                 rules and the rules of the other modules to which it is
                 connected by the ``isa'' hierarchy as global rules. In
                 this way, as local rules may hide global rules, it is
                 possible to deal with default properties and
                 exceptions. This new approach represents a novel
                 attempt to combine the logic paradigm with the
                 object-oriented one in knowledge base systems.
                 Moreover, this approach provides a new ground for
                 explaining some recent proposals of semantics for
                 classical logic programs with negation in the rule
                 bodies and gives an interesting semantics to logic

                 transaction model have been proposed to support new
                 information-intensive applications such as CAD/CAM and
                 software development. However, these extended models
                 capture only a subset of interactions that can be found
                 in such applications, and represent only some of the
                 points within the spectrum of interactions possible in
                 competitive and cooperative environments. \par

                 {\em ACTA\/} is a formalizable framework developed for
                 characterizing the whole spectrum of interactions. The
                 ACTA framework is {\em not\/} yet another transaction
                 model, but is intended to unify the existing models.
                 ACTA allows for specifying the {\em structure\/} and
                 the {\em behavior\/} of transactions as well as for
                 reasoning about the concurrency and recovery properties
                 of the transactions. In ACTA, the semantics of
                 interactions are expressed in terms of transactions'
                 effects on the commit and abort of other transactions
                 and on objects' state and concurrency status (i.e.,
                 synchronization state). Its ability to capture the
                 semantics of previously proposed transaction models is
                 indicative of its generality. The reasoning
                 capabilities of this framework have also been tested by
                 using the framework to study the properties of a new
                 model that is derived by combining two existing

                 paper, we show that the stable model semantics for
                 logic programs provides a unified basis for the
                 treatment of both concepts. First, we introduce the
                 concepts of partial models, stable models, strongly
                 founded models and deterministic models and other
                 interesting classes of partial models and study their
                 relationships. We show that the maximal deterministic
                 model of a program is a subset of the intersection of
                 all its stable models and that the well-founded model
                 of a program is a subset of its maximal deterministic
                 model. Then, we show that the use of stable models

  abstract =     "The use of non-deterministic database languages is
                 motivated using pragmatic and theoretical
                 considerations. It is shown that non-determinism
                 resolves some difficulties concerning the expressive
                 power of deterministic languages: there are
                 non-deterministic languages expressing low complexity
                 classes of queries/updates, whereas no such
                 deterministic languages exist. Various mechanisms
                 yielding non-determinism are reviewed. The focus is on
                 two closely related families of non-deterministic
                 languages. The first consists of extensions of {\em
                 Datalog\/} with negations in bodies and/or heads of
                 rules, with non-deterministic fixpoint semantics. The
                 second consists of non-deterministic extensions of
                 first-order logic and fixpoint logics, using the {\em
                 witness\/} operator. The ability of the various
                 non-deterministic languages to express {\em
                 deterministic\/} transformation is characterized. In
                 particular, non-deterministic languages expressing
                 exactly the queries/updates computable in polynomial
                 time are exhibited, whereas it is conjectured that no
                 analogous deterministic language exists. The connection
                 between non-deterministic languages and determinism is
                 also explored. Several problems of practical interest
                 are examined, such as checking (statically or
                 dynamically) if a given program is deterministic,
                 detecting coincidence of deterministic and
                 non-deterministic semantics, and verifying termination
                 for non-deterministic programs.",

                 necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence
                 of strictly optimal allocation methods. Based on a
                 class of optimal codes, known as maximum distance
                 separable codes, strictly optimal allocation methods
                 are constructed. Using the necessary conditions proved,
                 we argue that the standard definition of strict
                 optimality is too strong, and cannot be attained in
                 general. A new criterion for optimality is therefore
                 defined whose objective is to design allocation methods
                 that yield a response time of one for all queries with
                 a minimum number of specified attributes. Using coding

                 Examples of these window-based queries include the
                 exist query (i.e., determining whether or not a spatial
                 feature exists inside a window) and the report query,

                 rule engines use a simple combination of hashing and

                 satisfaction problems has a long history. Only more

                 as primitive constructs in programming languages has
                 been addressed. A main task that the designers and
                 implementors of such languages face is to use and adapt
                 the concepts and algorithms from the extensive studies

                 Randomized algorithms, such as Simulated Annealing (SA)
                 and Iterative Improvement (II), are viable alternatives
                 to exhaustive search. We have adapted these algorithms

                 evaluation of Datalog programs. One approach, called

                 that bottom-up fixpoint evaluation of the program
                 avoids generation of irrelevant facts ([BMSU86, BR87,
                 Ram88]). It is widely believed that the principal
                 application of the Magic-Sets technique is to restrict
                 computation in recursive queries using equijoin
                 predicates. We extend the Magic-Set transformation to
                 use predicates other than equality ({$X$} 10, for
                 example). This Extended Magic-Set technique has
                 practical utility in ``real'' relational databases, not
                 only for recursive queries, but for non-recursive
                 queries as well; in ([MFPR90]) we use the results in
                 this paper and those in [MPR89] to define a magic-set
                 transformation for relational databases supporting SQL
                 and its extensions, going on to describe an
                 implementation of magic in Starburst ([HFLP89]). We

                 for conventional database systems have shown that,
                 under most operating circumstances, locking protocols
                 outperform optimistic techniques. Real-time database
                 systems have special characteristics - timing
                 constraints are associated with transactions,
                 performance criteria are based on satisfaction of these
                 timing constraints, and scheduling algorithms are
                 priority driven. In light of these special
                 characteristics, results regarding the performance of
                 concurrency control algorithms need to be re-evaluated.
                 We show in this paper that the following parameters of
                 the real-time database system - its policy for dealing
                 with transactions whose constraints are not met, its
                 knowledge of transaction resource requirements, and the

                 on the relative performance of the concurrency control
                 algorithms. In particular, we demonstrate that under a
                 policy that discards transactions whose constraints are
                 not met, optimistic concurrency control outperforms
                 locking over a wide range of system utilization. We
                 also outline why, for a variety of reasons, optimistic

                 transformed into search regions. The requirement for

  abstract =     "Executing a transaction in a conventional distributed
                 database system involves the execution of several
                 subtransactions, each at a remote site where the data
                 reside and running a two-phase commit protocol at the
                 end of the transaction. With the advent of fast
                 communication networks, we consider an alternative
                 paradigm where the remote data being accessed are
                 dynamically {\em migrated\/} to the initiation site of
                 the transaction. One example of such a system is a
                 distributed shared virtual memory system. \par

                 In this paper, we examine the problem of recovery from
                 system failure in data migration systems. Most data
                 migration systems use the notion of {\em tokens\/} for
                 the access rights a site has on the data elements it
                 caches. Our goal is to recover the site's knowledge of
                 the set of tokens it owned when a system failure
                 occurred. Our approach is to consider the token
                 knowledge at each site as a fragment of a global {\em
                 token database\/} and the data migration activities as
                 {\em token transactions\/} that update this distributed
                 database. We have developed a unique commit protocol
                 for token transactions, called {\em unilateral
                 commit\/} (UCP), that efficiently achieves consistency
                 and recoverability of the token state. The correctness
                 of UCP with respect to the two-phase commit protocol is
                 also presented.",

                 is to maintain redundant separate structures
                 (disassociated from the object representation) to store
                 object references that are frequently traversed in
                 database queries. The proposed access support relation
                 technique is no longer restricted to relate an object
                 (tuple) to an atomic value (attribute value) as in
                 conventional indexing. Rather, access support relations
                 relate objects with each other and can span over
                 reference chains which may contain collection-valued
                 components in order to support queries involving path

                 relations and their application is developed. This
                 analytical cost model is, in particular, used to
                 determine the best access support relation extension

  abstract =     "Querying databases to obtain information requires the
                 user's knowledge of query language and underlying data.
                 However, because the knowledge in human long-term
                 memory is imprecise, incomplete, and often incorrect,
                 user queries are subject to various types of failure.
                 These may include spelling mistakes, the violation of
                 the syntax and semantics of a query language, and the
                 misconception of the entities and relationships in a
                 database. \par

                 Kaleidoscope is a cooperative query interface whose
                 knowledge guides users to avoid most failure during
                 query creation. We call this type of cooperative
                 behavior {\em intraquery guidance}. To enable this
                 early, active engagement in the user's process of query
                 creation, Kaleidoscope reduces the granularity of
                 user-system interaction via a context-sensitive menu.
                 The system generates valid query constituents as menu
                 choices step-by-step by interpreting a language
                 grammar, and the user creates a query following this
                 menu guidance[2]. For instance, it takes four steps to
                 create the following query [Q1] Who/ {\em 1\/}
                 authored/ {\em 2\/} `Al'/ {\em 3\/} journal papers/
                 {\em (3+)\/} in `Postquery COOP'/ {\em 4\/} \par

                 At each of such steps, as the user selects one of menu
                 choices, the system updates its partial query status
                 window. If a choice is unique as in {\em (3+)}, it is
                 taken automatically. To guide the user's entry of
                 values, the system provides a pop-up menu for each
                 value domain. \par

                 With Kaleidoscope's process of choice generation
                 tightly controlled by the system's knowledge of query
                 language and underlying data, users need not remember
                 the query language and the underlying database
                 structure but merely recognize or identify the
                 constituents coming one after another that match their
                 intended query. The system provides additional guidance
                 for users to avoid creating semantically inconsistent
                 queries. It informs the user of any derived predicates
                 on the completion of a user-selected predicate. To
                 illustrate this, consider a partially constructed SQL
                 query [Q2] SELECT * FROM professor p\#1 WHERE p\#1 dept
                 = `CS' AND p\#1 salary 40000 \par

                 Suppose that the system has an integrity constraint
                 [IC] FROM professor p IF p dept = `CS' AND p salary
                 45000 THEN p rank = `Assistant' \par

                 This rules states that a CS professor whose salary is
                 less than 45000 is an assistant professor. With the
                 replacement of rule variable p in IC by Q2's range
                 variable p\#1, IC's leading two predicates subsume Q2's
                 query condition, producing p\#1 rank = `Assistant'.
                 Because this derived predicate is not subsumed by Q2's
                 query condition, the system suspects that the user may
                 not know of it and presents it to the user.
                 \par

                 Derived predicates, together with user-selected ones,
                 constrain the user's further conjunctive extension of
                 the partial query condition. For example, the system
                 prunes the field rank (as well as the field dept) in
                 the conjunctive extension of Q2, because the derived
                 condition restricts the value of this field to a
                 constant. \par

                 As shown in examples, we apply Kaleidoscope's approach
                 to two linear-syntax languages in different levels of
                 abstraction SQL[1] and a query language whose syntax
                 and semantics cover a subset of {\em wh\/} -queries. To
                 implement the intraquery guidance, we extend
                 context-free grammar by associating context variables
                 with each grammar symbol and attaching several types of
                 procedural decorations to grammar rules. This extension
                 enables the system to capture the semantic constraints
                 and its user-guiding actions in a domain-independent
                 grammar. As the grammar is interpreted, the
                 database-specific information is fed from the system's
                 lexicon and knowledge base. The current implementation
                 of Kaleidoscope runs on a XEROX-1186 LISP machine with
                 a SUN server configured with a relational DBMS.
                 \par

                 The approach of Kaleidoscope is based on the normative
                 system assumption. The system presents its capability
                 transparent",

                 the ongoing implementation of the G + Visual Query
                 System for visualizing both data and queries as graphs.
                 The system provides an environment for expressing
                 queries in {\em GraphLog\/} [Con89, CM89, CM90], as
                 well as for browsing, displaying and editing graphs.
                 The visual query system also supports displaying the
                 answers in several different ways. \par

                 Graphs are a very natural representation for data in
                 many application domains, for example, transportation
                 networks, project scheduling, parts hierarchies, family
                 trees, concept hierarchies, and Hypertext. From a
                 broader perspective, many databases can be naturally
                 viewed as graphs. In particular, any relational
                 database in which we can identify one or more sets of
                 objects of interest and relationships between them can
                 be represented by mapping these objects into nodes and
                 relationships into edges. In the case of semantic and
                 object-oriented databases, there is a natural mapping
                 of objects to nodes and attributes to edges.
                 \par

                 GraphLog is a visual query language, based on a graph
                 representation of both data and queries, that has
                 evolved from the earlier language G + [CMW87, CMW89,
                 MW89]. GraphLog queries ask for patterns that must be
                 present or absent in the database graph. Each such
                 pattern, called a {\em query graph}, defines new edges
                 that are added to the graph whenever the pattern is
                 found. GraphLog queries are sets of query graphs,
                 called {\em graphical queries}. If, when looking at a
                 query graph in a graphical query, we do not find an
                 edge label in the database, then there must exist
                 another query graph in the graphical query defining
                 that edge. The language also supports computing
                 aggregate functions and summarizing along paths.
                 \par

                 The G + Visual Query System is currently implemented in
                 Smalltalk-80, and runs on Sun 3, Sun 4 and Macintosh II
                 workstations. A Graph Editor is available for editing
                 query graphs and displaying database graphs. It
                 supports graph ``cutting and pasting'', as well as text
                 editing of node and edge labels, node and edge
                 repositioning and re-shaping, storage and retrieval of
                 graphs as text files, etc. Automatic graph layout is
                 also provided. For editing collections of graphs (such
                 as graphical queries) a Graph Browser is available.
                 \par

                 The first answer mode supported by the G + Visual Query
                 System is to return as the result of a GraphLog query a
                 graph with the new edges defined by the graphical query
                 added to the database graph. \par

                 An alternative way of visualizing answers is by
                 high-lighting on the database graph, one at a time, the
                 paths (or just the nodes) described by the query. This
                 mode is particularly useful to locate interesting
                 starting points for browsing. \par

                 Rather than viewing the answers superimposed on the
                 database graph, the user may choose to view them in a
                 Graph Browser. The Graph Browser contains the set of
                 subgraphs of the database graph that were found to
                 satisfy the query. \par

                 Finally, the user may select to collect all the
                 subgraphs of the database graph that satisfy the query
                 together into one new graph. This graph (as well as any
                 other result graph from any of the above mentioned
                 answer modes) in turn may be queried, providing a
                 mechanism for iterative filtering of irrelevant
                 information until a manageable subgraph is obtained.",

                 intended for users who do not want to write programs in
                 Ode's database programming language O++ to interact
                 with Ode but instead want to use a friendlier interface
                 to Ode. OdeView is based on the graphical direct
                 manipulation paradigm that involves selection of items
                 from pop-up menus and icons that can be clicked on and
                 dragged. OdeView provides facilities for examining the
                 database schema examining class definitions, browsing
                 objects, following chains of references, displaying
                 selected portions of objects or selecting a subset of
                 the ways in which an object can be displayed
                 (projection), and retrieving specific objects
                 (selection). \par

                 Upon entering OdeView, the user is presented with a
                 scrollable ``database'' window containing the names and
                 iconified images of the current Ode databases. The user
                 can select a database to interact with by using the
                 mouse to click on the appropriate icon. OdeView then
                 opens a ``class relationship'' window which displays
                 the hierarchy relationship between the object classes
                 database. The hierarchy relationship between classes is
                 a set of dags. \par

                 The user can zoom in and zoom out to examine this dag
                 at various levels of detail. The user can also examine
                 a class in detail by clicking at the node labeled with
                 the class of interest. Clicking results in the opening
                 of a ``class information'' window that has three
                 scrollable subwindows, one showing its superclasses,
                 the second its subclasses, and the third showing the
                 meta data associated with this class. \par

                 The class information window also has a button,
                 clicking which shows the class definition. The user may
                 continue schema browsing by selecting another node in
                 the schema graph, or may click on one of the
                 superclasses or subclasses. Associated with each class
                 in Ode a the set of persistent objects of that class,
                 called cluster. The class definition window has an
                 ``objects'' button that allows users to browse through
                 the objects in the cluster. Clicking this button opens
                 the ``object set'' window which consists of two parts
                 the control and object panels. The control panel
                 consists of buttons reset, next, and previous to
                 sequence through the objects. The object panel has
                 buttons to view the object, projection (to view parts
                 of the object), and to specify the selection criteria.
                 \par

                 An Ode object can be displayed in one or more formats
                 depending upon the semantics of the display function
                 associated with the corresponding class. The object set
                 window supplies one button each for each of the object
                 display formats. For example, an employee object can be
                 displayed textually or in pictorial form, the object
                 panel for employee will provides appropriate buttons to
                 see these displays. An object may contain embedded
                 references to other objects. The object panel of an
                 object set window provides buttons for viewing these
                 referenced objects. The basic browsing paradigm
                 encouraged by OdeView is to start from an object and
                 then explore the related objects in the database by
                 following the embedded chains of references. To speed
                 up such repetitive navigations, OdeView supports {\em
                 synchronized browsing}. Once the user has displayed a
                 network of objects and the user applies a sequencing
                 operation to any object in this network, the sequencing
                 operation is automatically propagated over the network.
                 \par

                 OdeView is implemented using X-Windows and HP-Widgets
                 on a SUN workstation running the UNIX system. The video
                 takes the viewers on a tour of OdeView, showing how a
                 user interacts with OdeView to examine the database
                 schema and the objects in the database.",

  abstract =     "Current query languages, such as SQL, assume that the
                 user is familiar with the database schema including the
                 attribute names, types, and relation associations. When
                 a user has imperfect knowledge of this information (or
                 when he balks at the data-processing orientation of the
                 required statements), he normally asks an experienced
                 analyst to perform his and hoc query. The Intelligent
                 Navigational Assistant (INA) was developed for the U S
                 Army as a prototype query tool that permits the users
                 to specify requests using only domain terms familiar to
                 them. Once a request is made, it is converted into SQL
                 for processing 1,2 \par

                 To facilitate query formulation, the INA supports an
                 interface that allows the user to identify attributes
                 without relation associations (i.e., treats the data
                 model as a universal relation). Because an attribute
                 may appear in many relations, one of the principal
                 tasks of the INA is the determination of the
                 appropriate relation bindings. To aid in the selection
                 of terms, the INA maintains a user vocabulary and
                 provides facilities for browsing the vocabulary and
                 examining term definitions. Thus, the INA has two
                 primary functions it provides an easy-to-use interface
                 for query definition, and it converts a request into
                 SQL. \par

                 The INA prototype has been implemented as a PC-resident
                 knowledge-based system linked to a host-based DBMS. Its
                 knowledge base is the logical schema of the target
                 database, and the query transformation relies on the
                 dependencies implicit in that schema. Supporting the
                 knowledge-processing functions are the query definition
                 interface, various tools to manage the target data
                 model description, and facilities for communicating
                 with other computers. The system was developed using
                 TEDIUM@@@@, 3 and the user interface and query
                 resolution mechanism are extensions of earlier work
                 with Tequila 4 (which accessed the semantically-richer
                 TEDIUM@@@@ data model) \par

                 Work on the INA began in 1987 and was terminated in
                 1988. The system was demonstrated as a prototype with
                 an Army-supplied logical model consisting of
                 approximately 40 relations and 200 attributes. After
                 query definition, reformation, and user acceptance, the
                 SQL queries were submitted to the mainframe for
                 processing. In those tests, the INA often produced
                 better queries than those manually coded by analysts.
                 The INA currently is undergoing a beta test with a much
                 larger database schema. Its algorithms are described in
                 reference 5, and reference 3 contains details regarding
                 its implementation and semantic data model. Current
                 research includes the development of improved query
                 resolution algorithms based on an enriched semantic

  abstract =     "Pasta-3 is an end-user interface for D/KBMSs based on
                 the graphical Direct Manipulation (DM) interaction
                 paradigm, which relies on a bit-mapped, multi-window
                 screen and a mouse to implement clickable icons as the
                 main representation of information. This style of
                 interaction enables end users to learn quickly and
                 remember easily how the system works. Pasta-3 gives
                 complete access to the D/KBMS, since its users can
                 carry out all manipulation tasks through it schema
                 definition, schema and data browsing, query
                 formulation, and updating. These tasks can be freely
                 mixed, combined, and switched Pasta-3 interfaces to the
                 KB2 knowledge base system, implemented in Prolog and
                 built over the EDUCE system which provides a tight
                 coupling to a relational DBMS KB2 uses the
                 Entity-Relationship data model, extended with
                 inheritance and deduction rules. KB2 was developed by
                 the KB Group at ECRC. \par

                 Pasta-3 uses Direct Manipulation in the strong sense of
                 the term DM of the actual graphical representations of
                 the application data and not just DM of commands
                 operating on that data. Besides the high degree of
                 integration in the overall design, major innovations
                 with respect to earlier work include enhanced schema
                 browsing with active functionalities to facilitate
                 correct user understanding of the KB structure,
                 ``synchronized'' data browsing that exploits the
                 underlying semantic data model to make browsing more
                 powerful, and a graphical query language providing full
                 expressive power (including certain recursive queries,
                 nested subqueries, quantification). \par

                 Pasta-3 provides interactive design support that has
                 significant ergonomic advantages over the usual
                 approach to this problem. In Pasta-3 different types of
                 schema information -- the basic E-R diagram, and
                 inheritance lattices, the properties of each E-R item
                 -- are displayed in separate windows, which makes
                 accurate reading of such information much less
                 difficult than in the usual case where all these layers
                 are thrown together in a single graph, which makes
                 misinterpretation hard to avoid. \par

                 For schema and data browsing, Pasta-3 offers facilities
                 that build more semantics into the browsing processes.
                 One type of schema browsing tool is a subgraph
                 computation capability which automatically finds and
                 displays the paths that connect arbitrary E-R items.
                 This helps end users to correctly perceive the schema
                 structure. Data browsing includes ``synchronised''
                 browsing, a functionality which shows simultaneously
                 data from several Entities all sharing the same
                 Relationship and indicates which values from each
                 Entity are associated with given values from the
                 others. \par

                 Pasta-3's DM query language replaces the textual
                 language without loss of expressive power it offers a
                 new, sophisticated DM editing capability for the same
                 formal constructs. Query specification takes place in a
                 window containing icons representing the components of
                 the query expression which can be created, destroyed,
                 and modified all by clicking and dragging through the
                 mouse. Queries can be recursive and involve logical
                 variables, quantification, and subqueries. Expressions
                 mixing both KB2 statements and Prolog predicates can
                 also be formulated. \par

                 The video shows Pasta-3 actually being used, in real
                 time and under normal conditions. It includes sequences
                 demonstrating all three major functionalities schema
                 design browsing, and querying. It gives an example of
                 the subgraph computation capability and builds a simple
                 query from scratch, going through all the steps needed
                 to do so. The demonstration also includes work with
                 other types of Pasta-3 windows (e.g., property sheets).

                 The video has an English-language sound track
                 explaining everything that is seen on the screen. The
                 camera zooms in and out in order to show full screen
                 overviews (giving a good idea of the general ``feel''
                 of the interface) and close-ups of work with mouse and
                 icons (allowing the viewer to see as much detail in the
                 video as an actual user would).",

                 being developed at Hewlett--Packard Laboratories [1],
                 [3]. This videotape provides an overview of the Iris
                 data model and a summary of our experiences in
                 converting a computer-integrated manufacturing
                 application to Iris. An abstract of the videotape
                 follows. \par

                 Iris is intended to meet the needs of new and emerging
                 database applications such as office and engineering
                 information systems, knowledge-based systems,
                 manufacturing applications, and hardware and software
                 design. These applications require a rich set of
                 capabilities that are not supported by the current
                 generation (i.e., relational) DBMSs. \par

                 The Iris data model is an object and function model. It
                 provides three basic constructs {\em objects, types\/}
                 and {\em functions}. As with other object systems, Iris
                 objects have a unique identifier and can only be
                 accessed and manipulated through functions. Objects are
                 classified by type. Objects that belong to the same
                 type share common functions. Types are organized into a
                 hierarchy with inherited functions. In Iris, functions
                 are used to model properties of objects, relationships
                 among objects and operations on objects. Thus, the
                 behavior of an Iris object is completely specified
                 through its participation in functions. \par

                 Iris provides good separation among its three basic
                 notions. This simplifies the data model making it
                 easier to learn and easier to implement since there are
                 fewer constructs than other object models. In addition,
                 it facilitates Iris support for the following desirable
                 features. Schema evolution: new types and functions may
                 be added at any time. Object evolution: Iris objects
                 may have multiple types and may acquire and lose types
                 dynamically. Object participation in functions may be
                 required or optional (e g, everyone has birthdate but
                 not everyone has a phone number). Data independence:
                 the implementation of a function is defined separately
                 from its interface. Thus, the implementation of a
                 function may change without affecting applications that
                 use it. Functional extensibility: an Iris function may
                 be implemented as a stored table, computed as an Iris
                 expression, or computed as a subroutine in a
                 general-purpose programming language. Thus, any
                 computation can be expressed as an Iris function Schema
                 and data uniformity: the metadata is modeled and
                 manipulated using the primitives of the data model.
                 Also, system functions (create type, delete object,
                 etc) are invoked in the same manner as user functions.
                 Thus, users need learn only one interface. Set
                 processing: Iris supports set-at-a-time processing for
                 efficient retrieval and update of collections of
                 objects. \par

                 To evaluate the usefulness of the Iris prototype, a
                 project was undertaken to convert a large relational
                 application to Iris [2]. The relational system
                 contained nearly 200 relations and 2500 attributes.
                 When transcribed to Iris, the schema size was reduced
                 by over a third. There are two reasons for this large
                 reduction. First, in the relational schema, many
                 attributes were simply foreign keys required for joins.
                 In the Iris schema, function inheritance through the
                 type hierarchy eliminates the need for many of these
                 foreign keys. A second reason for the schema reduction
                 was that compound keys were replaced by object
                 references. This permitted several attributes in a
                 relation to be replaced by a single identifier \par

                 It was noted that application programs were easier to
                 read and develop using the Iris schema. The Iris OSQL
                 (Object SQL) language was a fairly natural interface
                 for users familiar with SQL. The use of function
                 composition and function inheritance and a large number
                 of joins that, in the relational system, must be
                 expressed by comparing keys. The function-orientation
                 of Iris encouraged {\em code sharing\/} in that
                 deriving and sharing new functions was simplified.
                 \par

                 Finally, since there are few tools and methodologies
                 for using object-oriented database management systems,

                 viable to reduce the response time of decision support
                 queries by using parallel execution to exploit
                 inexpensive resources. This goal poses the following
                 query optimization problem: {\em Minimize response time
                 subject to constraints on throughput}, which we
                 motivate as the dual of the traditional DBMS problem.
                 We address this novel problem in the context of
                 Select-Project-Join queries by extending the execution
                 space, cost model and search algorithm that are widely
                 used in commercial DBMSs. We incorporate the sources
                 and deterrents of parallelism in the traditional
                 execution space. We show that a cost model can predict
                 response time while accounting for the new aspects due
                 to parallelism. We observe that the response time
                 optimization metric violates a fundamental assumption
                 in the dynamic programming algorithm that is the
                 linchpin in the optimizers of most commercial DBMSs. We
                 extend dynamic programming and show how optimization

                 gained increased popularity due to their high
                 performance, scalability and availability
                 characteristics. With the predicted future database
                 sizes and the complexity of queries, the scalability of
                 these systems to hundreds and thousands of processors
                 is essential for satisfying the projected demand.
                 Several studies have repeatedly demonstrated that both
                 the performance and scalability of a parallel database
                 system is contingent on the physical layout of data
                 across the processors of the system. If the data is not
                 declustered properly, the execution of an operator
                 might waste resources, reducing the overall processing
                 capability of the system. \par

                 With earlier, single attribute declustering strategies,
                 such as those found in Tandem, Teradata, Gamma, and
                 Bubba parallel database systems, a selection query
                 including a range predicate on any attribute other than
                 the partitioning attribute must be sent to all
                 processors containing tuples of the relation. By
                 directing a query with minimal resource requirements to
                 processors that contain no relevant tuples, the system
                 wastes CPU cycles, communication bandwidth, and I/O
                 bandwidth, reducing its overall processing capability.
                 As a solution, several multi-attribute declustering
                 strategies have been proposed. However, the performance
                 of these declustering techniques have not previously
                 been compared to one another nor with a single
                 attribute partitioning strategy. This paper, compares
                 the performance of Multi-Attribute GrId deClustering
                 (MAGIC) strategy and Bubba's Extended Range
                 Declustering (BERD) strategy with one another and with
                 the range partitioning strategy. Our results indicate

                 reduce a given query to a series of attempted
                 retrievals from a database of facts. The Qp's {\em
                 expected cost\/} is the average time it requires to
                 find an answer, averaged over its anticipated set of
                 queries. This cost depends on Qp's {\em strategy},
                 which specifies the order in which it considers the
                 possible rules and retrievals. This paper provides two
                 related learning algorithms, PIB and PAO, for improving
                 the QP's strategy, i.e., for producing new strategies
                 with lower expected costs. Each algorithm first
                 monitors the Qp's operations over a set of queries,
                 observing how often each path of rules leads to a
                 sufficient set of successful retrievals, and then uses
                 these statistics to suggest a new strategy. PIB
                 hill-climbs to strategies that are, with high
                 probability, successively better; and PAO produces a
                 new strategy that probably is approximately optimal. We

                 the range of motion of the disk arm is the interval
                 [0,1]. In this model, both the current location of the
                 disk arm and the location of the next request are
                 assumed to be points uniformly distributed on the
                 interval [0,1] and therefore the expected seek distance
                 to service the next request is 1/3. In many types of
                 databases including scientific, object oriented, and
                 multimedia database systems, a disk service request may
                 involve fetching very large objects which must be

                 based on a mix of patterns, events, and transitions.
                 For testing rule conditions, Ariel makes use of a

                 structure for testing single-relation selection

                 at rule fire time, and executes the rule action using

                 negation, set-terms and grouping. The valid model
                 semantics is a three-valued semantics, and is defined
                 in terms of a normal form computation. The valid model
                 semantics also gives meaning to the generation and use
                 of non-ground facts (i.e., facts with variables) in a
                 computation. \par

                 The formulation of the semantics in terms of a normal
                 form computation offers important insight not only into
                 the valid model semantics, but also into other
                 semantics proposed earlier. We show that the valid
                 model semantics extends the well-founded semantics in a
                 natural manner, and has several advantages over it. The
                 well-founded semantics can also be understood using a
                 variant of the normal form computations that we use;
                 the normal form computations used for valid semantics
                 seem more natural than those used for well-founded
                 semantics. \par

                 We also show that the valid model semantics has several
                 other desirable properties: it is founded ([SZ90]), it
                 is contained in every regular model ([YY90]), and it is

                 useful for real-time databases. Our approach is
                 motivated from two main observations. First, locking
                 protocols are widely accepted and used in most database
                 systems. Second, in real-time databases it has been
                 shown that the blocking behavior of transactions in
                 locking protocols results in performance degradation.
                 We use a new relationship between locks called ordered
                 sharing to eliminate blocking that arises in the
                 traditional locking protocols. Ordered sharing
                 eliminates blocking of read and write operations but
                 may result in delayed commitment. Since in real-time
                 databases, timeliness and not response time is the
                 crucial factor, or protocols exploit this delay to
                 allow transactions to execute within the slacks of
                 delayed transactions. We compare the performance of the
                 proposed protocols with the two phase locking protocol
                 for real-time databases. Our experiments indicate that
                 the propose protocols significantly reduce the

                 known tool used for efficiently solving many classical
                 computational problems within the framework of
                 procedural languages. However, it is very difficult to
                 express these algorithms within the declarative
                 framework of logic-based languages. In this paper, we
                 extend the framework of Datalog-like languages to
                 provide simple and declarative formulations of such
                 problems, with computational complexities comparable to
                 those of procedural formulations. This is achieved
                 through the use of constructs, such as least and
                 choice, that have semantics reducible to that of
                 negative programs under stable model semantics.
                 Therefore, we show that the formulation of greedy
                 algorithms using these constructs lead to a syntactic
                 class of programs, called stage-stratified programs,
                 that are easily recognized at compile time. The
                 fixpoint-based implementation of these recursive
                 programs is very efficient and, combined with suitable
                 storage structures, yields asymptotic complexities

                 specified, different retention policies can be devised.

                 in logic, either as first order sentences ({\em min,
                 max,\/} etc.), or with elementary induction over a data
                 structure that represents the relation ({\em sum,
                 count,\/} etc.). The well-founded semantics for logic
                 programs provides an interpretation of such
                 definitions. The interpretation of first-order
                 aggregates seems to be quite natural and intuitively
                 satisfying, even in the presence of recursion through
                 aggregation. Care is needed to get useful results on
                 inductive aggregates, however. A basic building block
                 is the ``subset'' predicate, which states that a data
                 structure represents a subset of an IDB predicate, and
                 which is definable in the well-founded semantics. The
                 analogous ``superset'' is also definable, and their
                 combination yields a ``generic'' form of {\em findall}.
                 Surprisingly, {\em findall\/} must be used negatively
                 to obtain useful approximations when the exact relation
                 is not yet known. \par

                 Extensions to the semantics, restrictions on the input,
                 and other supplementary requirements proposed in
                 earlier studies appear to be unnecessary for the
                 purpose of {\em attaching a meaning\/} to a program
                 that involves recursion through aggregation. For
                 example, any reasonable definition of ``shortest
                 paths'' tolerates negative weight edges, correctly
                 computes shortest paths that exist, and leave tuples
                 undefined where negative-weight cycles cause the
                 shortest path not to exist. Other examples exhibit
                 similarly robust behavior, when defined carefully.

                 result, the access scope of a query against a class in
                 general includes the access scope of all its
                 subclasses, unless specified otherwise. To support the
                 superclass-subclass relationship efficiently, the index

                 systems, a criterion based on the number of nodes may
                 be misleading. Second, we propose a way to reduce

                 distributed commit protocols, the protocols may block
                 in some partitions to avoid inconsistent termination of
                 the transaction, thus making data items in these
                 partitions unavailable for accesses. We present a
                 protocol that incorporates two new ideas with the goal
                 of improving data availability. First, a new two-level
                 voting scheme is proposed for deciding in which
                 partitions to terminate the transaction. In this
                 scheme, a choice is made based on the number of data
                 items available in the partition rather than on the
                 number of individual nodes. Indeed, in replicated
                 systems, a criterion based on the number of nodes may
                 be misleading. Second, we propose a way to reduce
                 blocking caused by accumulating network fragmentation.
                 The idea employs the {\em views\/} mechanism previously

                 different workloads based upon the Tektronix benchmark.
                 For all four workloads, stochastic clustering gave the
                 best performance for a variety of performance metrics.
                 Since stochastic clustering is computationally
                 expensive, it is interesting that for every workload
                 there was at least one cheaper clustering algorithm
                 that matched or almost matched stochastic clustering.
                 Unfortunately, for each workload, the algorithm that
                 approximated stochastic clustering was different. Our
                 experiments also demonstrated that even when the
                 workload and object graph are fixed, the choice of the
                 clustering algorithm depends upon the goals of the
                 system. For example, if the goal is to perform well on
                 traversals of small portions of the database starting
                 with a cold cache, the important metric is the
                 per-traversal expansion factor, and a well-chosen
                 placement tree will be nearly optimal; if the goal is
                 to achieve a high steady-state performance with a
                 reasonably large cache, the appropriate metric is the
                 number of pages to which the clustering algorithm maps
                 the active portion of the database. For this metric,
                 the PRP clustering algorithm, which only uses access
                 probabilities achieves nearly optimal performance.",

                 often cannot be avoided. Even if sophisticated indexing
                 mechanisms are provided, it may be necessary to
                 evaluate simple predicates against data stored on disk
                 for filtering. For traditional record oriented data
                 models i/o and buffer management are the main
                 bottlenecks for this operation, the interpretation of
                 data structures is straightforward and usually not an
                 important cost factor. For heterogeneously shaped

                 Our initial model assumes a read/write ratio of one,

                 ``hot set'' model (i.e., x% of the accesses go to y% of

                 recovery is dominated by data I/O costs, but under
                 extreme hot-set conditions, this may no longer be true.

                 meant building a system that copes well with important
                 special cases. Recent work on multi-level systems
                 suggest a systematic path to high concurrency. A
                 multi-level system using locks permits restrictive low
                 level locks of a subtransaction to be replaced with
                 less restrictive high level locks when sub-transactions
                 commit, enhancing concurrency. This is possible because
                 sub-transactions can be undone via high level
                 compensation actions rather than by restoring a prior
                 lower level state. We describe a recovery scheme,
                 called Multi-Level Recovery (MLR) that logs this high
                 level undo operation with the commit record for the
                 subtransaction that it compensates, posting log records
                 to only a single log. A variant of the method copes
                 with nested transactions, and both nested and
                 multi-level transactions can be treated in a unified
                 fashion.",

                 accelerate the performance of spacial access methods
                 and specifically, R-trees [11]. Our goal is to design a
                 server for spatial data, so that to maximize the
                 throughput of range queries. This can be achieved by
                 (a) maximizing parallelism for large range queries, and
                 (b) by engaging as few disks as possible on point
                 queries [22]. \par

                 We propose a simple hardware architecture consisting of
                 one processor with several disks attached to it. On
                 this architecture, we propose to distribute the nodes
                 of a traditional R-tree, with cross-disk pointers
                 (``Multiplexed'' R-tree). The R-tree code is identical
                 to the one for a single-disk R-tree, with the only
                 addition that we have to decide which disk a newly
                 created R-tree node should be stored in. We propose and
                 examine several criteria to choose a disk for a new
                 node. The most successful one, termed ``proximity
                 index'' or PI, estimates the similarity of the new node
                 with the other R-tree nodes already on a disk, and
                 chooses the disk with the lowest similarity.
                 Experimental results show that our scheme consistently
                 outperforms all the other heuristics for node-to-disk
                 assignments, achieving up to 55% gains over the Round
                 Robin one. Experiments also indicate that the
                 multiplexed R-tree with PI heuristic gives better
                 response time than the disk-stripping (=``Super-node'')
                 approach, and imposes lighter load on the I/O
                 sub-system. \par

                 The speed up of our method is close to linear speed up,

                 a query is transferred from the user to the database
                 system. A natural first step is to use the typing
                 constraints imposed by the schema to transform a query
                 into an equivalent one that logically accesses a

                 slow or halted process can render part or all of the
                 data structure inaccessible to other processes.
                 \par

                 This paper proposes a technique that can convert most

                 into nonblocking algorithms with the same

                 transformation can be applied to any algorithm having
                 the following properties: \par

                 Interprocess synchronization is established solely
                 through the use of locks. \par

                 There is no possiblity of deadlock (e.g., because of a
                 well-ordering among the lock requests). \par

                 In contrast to a previous work, our transformation
                 requires only a constant amount of overhead per
                 operation and, in the absence of failures, it incurs no
                 penalty in the amount of concurrency that was available
                 in the original data structure. \par

  abstract =     "Recently, the scope of databases has been extended to
                 many non-standard applications, and serializability is
                 found to be too restrictive for such applications. In
                 general, two approaches are adopted to address this
                 problem. The first approach considers placing more
                 structure on data objects to exploit type specific
                 properties while keeping serializability as the
                 correctness criterion. The other approach uses explicit
                 semantics of transactions and databases to permit
                 interleaved executions of transactions that are
                 non-serializable. In this paper, we attempt to bridge
                 the gap between the two approaches by using the notion
                 of serializability with bounded inconsistency. Users
                 are free to specify the maximum level of inconsistency
                 that can be allowed in the executions of operations
                 dynamically. In particular, if no inconsistency is
                 allowed in the execution of any operation, the protocol
                 will be reduced to a standard strict two phase locking
                 protocol based on type-specific semantics of data
                 objects. Bounded inconsistency can be applied to many
                 areas which do not require exact values of the data
                 such as for gathering information for statistical
                 purpose, for making high level decisions and reasoning
                 in expert systems which can tolerate uncertainty in

                 the optimization problem which has to deal with
                 recursive queries on complex objects. Because unary
                 operations invoking methods or path expressions on

  abstract =     "Support for temporal data continues to be a
                 requirement posed by many applications such as VLSI
                 design and CAD, but also in conventional applications
                 like banking and sales. Furthermore, the strong demand
                 for complex-object support is known as an inherent fact
                 in design applications, and also emerges for advance
                 ``conventional'' applications. Thus, new advanced
                 database management systems should include both
                 features, i.e., should support {\em temporal
                 complex-objects}. In this paper, we present such a
                 temporal complex-object data model. The central notion
                 of our temporal complex-object data model is a {\em
                 time slice}, representing one state of a complex
                 object. We explain the mapping of time slices onto the
                 complex objects supported by the MAD model (which we
                 use for an example of a {\em non-temporal\/}
                 complex-object data model) as well as the
                 transformation process of operations on temporal
                 complex-objects into MAD model operations. Thereby, the
                 basic properties of the MAD model are a prerequisite
                 for our approach. For example, time slices can only be
                 directly stored, if non-disjunct (i.e., over-lapping)
                 complex objects are easily handled in the underlying
                 complex-object data model.",

                 systems; and \par

                 knows the set of transactions that may run during a
                 certain interval (users are likely to have such
                 knowledge for online or real-time transactional
                 applications). \par

                 Given this information, our algorithm finds the finest
                 partitioning of a set of transactions TranSet with the
                 following property; if the partitioned transactions
                 execute serializably, then TranSet executes
                 serializably. This permits users to obtain more
                 concurrency while preserving correctness. Besides
                 obtaining more inter-transaction concurrency, chopping
                 transactions in this way can enhance intra-transaction
                 parallelism. \par

                 The algorithm is inexpensive, running in {$O(n x (e +
                 m))$} time using a naive implementation where {$n$} is
                 the number of edges in the conflict graph among the
                 transactions, and $m$ is the maximum number of accesses
                 of any transaction. This makes it feasible to add as a
                 tuning knob to practical systems.",

                 existing ones or when an application is to be

                 extend deductive databases by the concept of {\em

                 evaluation, not only variables, but also predicates can
                 be substituted. This paper continues our earlier work
                 on predicate substitution in two directions: (i) We

                 continuous queries\/} examine only single records, this
                 can be implemented by examining each record as it
                 arrives. This is very efficient because only the
                 incoming record needs to be scanned. This simple
                 approach does not work for queries involving joins or
                 time. The Tapestry system allows users to issue such
                 queries over a database of mail and bulletin board
                 messages. The user issues a static query, such as
                 ``show me all messages that have been replied to by
                 Jones,'' as though the database were fixed and

                 incremental query that efficiently finds new matches to
                 the original query as new messages are added to the
                 database. This paper describes the techniques used in
                 Tapestry, which do not depend on triggers and thus be
                 implemented on any commercial database that supports

                 execute such queries under a reduced degree of
                 consistency, thus providing non-serializable answers.
                 In this paper, we present a new and highly concurrent
                 approach for processing large decision support queries
                 in relational databases. In this new approach, called
                 compensation-based query processing, concurrent updates
                 to any data participating in a query are communicated
                 to the query's on-line query processor, which then
                 compensates for these updates so that the final answer
                 reflects changes caused by the updates. Very high
                 concurrency is achieved by locking data only briefly,

                 relational model. We extend relational algebra with
                 operators for accessing relations, and also define a
                 relational calculus based on the logic HiLog. We prove
                 two equivalence results between extensions of
                 relational algebra provide higher expressive power than
                 relational algebra on any given database. Finally, we
                 argue that the extensions proposed here are relatively
                 easy to provide in practice, and should be expressible

                 cannot guarantee optimal join expressions in its search
                 space because the cheapest Cartesian-product-free (CPF,

                 Exploiting Semantics for Index Management) , for
                 concurrency control and recovery of B + -trees.
                 ARIES/IM guarantees serializability and uses
                 write-ahead logging for recovery. It supports very high
                 concurrency and good performance by (1) treating as the
                 lock of a key the same lock as the one on the
                 corresponding record data in a data page (e.g., at the
                 record level), (2) not acquiring, in the interest of
                 permitting very high concurrency, commit duration locks
                 on index pages even during index structure modification
                 operations (SMOs) like page splits and page deletions,
                 and (3) allowing retrievals, inserts, and deletes to go
                 on concurrently with SMOs. During restart recovery, any
                 necessary {\em redos\/} of index changes are always
                 performed in a page-oriented fashion (i.e., without
                 traversing the index tree) and, during normal
                 processing and restart recovery, whenever possible {\em
                 undos\/} are performed in a page-oriented fashion.
                 ARIES/IM permits different granularities of locking to
                 be supported in a flexible manner. A subset of ARIES/IM
                 has been implemented in the OS/2 Extended Edition

                 implemented in SQL/DS and the VM Shared File System,

                 computing the transitive closure of a graph for a
                 specific set of source nodes. Algorithms for this
                 problem can be directly applied to many nonrecursive
                 queries as well. We give a new algorithm and show that
                 it is superior to several previous algorithms. We then
                 consider Warshall's transitive closure algorithm. This
                 algorithm is not {$O(n e)$}, but we show that by using
                 trees instead flat representations of intermediary
                 results, we can derive a new version of the algorithm
                 with an {$O(n e)$} upper bound.",

                 As a first step, we focus essentially on the logical

                 a formalism (i) that unifies different rewriting
                 formalisms, (ii) that allows easy and exhaustive
                 factorization of duplicated subqueries, and (iii) that
                 supports heuristics in order to reduce the optimization
                 rewriting phase. \par

                 Vadaparty for dealing with limited forms of disjunctive
                 information in database queries. Independently, Rounds
                 used a similar notion for representing disjunctive and
                 conjunctive information in the context of situation
                 theory. In this paper we formulate a query language
                 with adequate expressive power for or-sets. Using the
                 notion of normalization of or-sets, queries at the
                 ``structural'' and ``conceptual'' levels are
                 distinguished. Losslessness of normalization is
                 established for a large class of queries. We have
                 obtained upper bounds for the cost of normalization. An
                 approach related to that of Rounds is used to provide
                 semantics for or-sets.",

  abstract =     "Bags, i.e. sets with duplicates, are often used to
                 implement relations in database systems. In this paper
                 we study the expressive power of algebras for
                 manipulating bags. The algebra we present is a simple
                 extension of the nested relation algebra. Our aim is to
                 investigate how the use of bags in the language extends
                 its expressive power, and increases its complexity. We
                 consider two main issues, namely (i) the relationship
                 between the depth of bag nesting and the expressive
                 power, and (ii) the relationship between the algebraic
                 operations, and their complexity and expressive power.
                 We show that the bag algebra is more expressive than
                 the nested relation algebra (at all levels of nesting),
                 and that the difference may be subtle. We establish a
                 hierarchy based on the structure of algebra
                 expressions. This hierarchy is shown to be highly
                 related to the properties of the powerset operator.",

                 type of theory change: arbitration. The key idea is the
                 following: the new information is considered neither
                 better nor worse than the old information represented
                 by the logical theory. The new information is simply
                 one voice against a set of others already incorporated
                 into the logical theory. From this follows that
                 arbitration should be commutative. First we define
                 arbitration by a set of postulates and then describe a
                 model-theoretic characterization of arbitration for the
                 case of propositional logical theories. We also study
                 weighted arbitration where different models of a theory
                 can have different weights.",

  abstract =     "The {\em Extended Commitment Ordering\/} (ECO)
                 property of transaction histories (schedules)
                 generalizes the {\em Commitment Ordering\/} (CO)
                 property defined in [Raz 90]. In a multi resource
                 manager (RM) environment ECO guarantees {\em global
                 serializability\/} when supported locally by each RM
                 that participates in {\em global transactions\/} (i.e.,
                 transactions that span more than a single RM) and
                 provides local serializability (by any mechanism). ECO
                 assumes that a RM has the knowledge to distinguish {\em
                 local transactions\/} (i.e., transactions confined to
                 that RM) from global transactions. ECO imposes an order
                 condition, similar to the CO condition, on the commit
                 events of global transactions only, and thus, it is
                 less constraining than CO. \par

                 Like CO, ECO provides a fully distributed solution to
                 the long standing problem of guaranteeing global
                 serializability across RMs with different concurrency
                 control mechanisms. Also, like CO, no communication
                 beyond {\em atomic commitment\/} (AC) protocol messages
                 is required to enforce ECO. \par

                 When RMs are provided with the information about
                 transactions being local, and are coordinated solely
                 via AC protocols (have the {\em extended knowledge
                 autonomy\/} property), ECO, applied locally together
                 with local serializability in each RM involved with
                 global transactions, is a necessary condition for
                 guaranteeing global serializability. \par

                 ECO reduces to CO when all the transactions are assumed
                 to be global (e.g., if no knowledge about the
                 transactions being local is available).",

                 predicates. We show that no effective procedure exists
                 for finding envelopes that best approximate the
                 fix-point ({\em tight envelopes\/}). Moreover, the
                 problem of determining existence of tight envelopes is
                 undecidable. The relationship between tight envelopes
                 and the boundedness property is explored. Although the
                 property of having tight envelopes seems weaker than
                 boundedness, we note that a predicate can have a tight
                 (lower) envelope iff it is bounded. On the other hand,
                 there exist Datalog predicates that are not bounded but
                 have tight (upper) envelopes. We relax our requirement

                 literature to give a semantics to non-Horn databases.
                 The first one is based on considering the set of rules
                 composing the programs as inference rules and
                 interpreting the negation in the body as failure to
                 prove. The other approach is based on the so-called
                 closed-world assumption and its objective is to define
                 a stronger notion of consequence from a theory than the
                 classical one, where, very roughly, negative
                 information can be inferred whenever its positive
                 counterpart cannot be deduced from the theory. In this
                 work we generalize the semantics for negation in logic
                 programs, putting together the constructive nature of
                 the rule-based deductive databases with the
                 syntax-independence of the closed-world reasoning
                 rules. These generalized semantics are shown to be a
                 well-motivated and well-founded alternative to
                 closed-world assumptions since they enjoy nice semantic
                 and computational properties.",

                 SLDNF) reflects the procedural interpretation of
                 Horn-clause predicate logic as a programming language
                 and forms the computational basis for prolog systems.
                 Despite its advantages in memory management, SLDNF is
                 often not appropriate for query evaluation for three
                 reasons; (a) it may not terminate due to infinite
                 positive recursion; (b) it may not terminate due to
                 infinite recursion through negation; and (c) it may
                 repeatedly evaluate the same clause body literal,
                 leading to unacceptable performance. \par

                 We address all three problems for goal-oriented query
                 evaluation of arbitrary programs by presenting an
                 extension of SLDNF, called {\em SLG resolution}, with
                 the following distinctive features: \par

                 (i) SLG resolution is a partial deduction procedure,
                 consisting of several transformations. Each query is
                 transformed step by step into a set of answer clauses;
                 \par

                 (ii) SLG resolution is sound and ideally complete for
                 all non-floundering queries with respect to all
                 three-valued stable models (including the well founded
                 partial model); \par

                 (iii) SLG resolution allows an arbitrary computation
                 rule and an arbitrary control strategy for selecting
                 transformations to apply; \par

                 (iv) SLG resolution avoids both positive and negative
                 loops and always terminates for programs with the
                 bounded-term-size property; \par

                 (v) SLG resolution has a polynomial time data
                 complexity for well founded negation. \par

                 Restricted forms of SLG resolution are identified for
                 definite, locally stratified, and modularly stratified
                 programs, thereby shedding light on the role each
                 transformation plays. To provide answers to a query
                 under different three-valued stable models, SLG
                 resolution can be enhanced by further processing of the
                 derived set of answer clauses. \par

                 SLG resolution makes many more clausal specifications
                 into effective programs. With simple (user or computer
                 generated) annotations, SLDNF resolution and SLG
                 resolution can be fully integrated. Thus a system
                 including SLG resolution can be fully integrated. Thus
                 a system including SLG resolution is naturally upward
                 compatible with Prolog. For all these reasons we
                 believe that SLG resolution will provide the
                 computational basis for the next generation of logic
                 programming systems.",

                 query optimization searches, where fast estimates are
                 needed as many alternative plans are examined. It is
                 shown that previous methods, which use an independence
                 assumption when several attributes are joined, can lead
                 to unrealistically low size estimates. This method
                 attempts to overcome that problem by the introduction
                 of ``virtual domains'', which avoid the independence
                 assumption. The method does not require extensive
                 statistics about the database. After describing an

                 indexing support for new data models. The database
                 languages of these models include concepts from
                 constraint programming (e.g., relational tuples are
                 generalized to conjunctions of constraints) and from
                 object-oriented programming (e.g., objects are
                 organized in class hierarchies). Let $n$ be the size of
                 the database, $c$ the number of classes, {$B$} the
                 secondary storage page size, and {$t$} the size of the
                 output of a query. Indexing by one attribute in the
                 constraint data model (for a fairly general type of
                 constraints) is equivalent to external dynamic interval
                 management, which is a special case of external dynamic
                 2-dimensional range searching. We present a
                 semi-dynamic data structure for this problem which has
                 optimal worst-case space {$O(n/B)$} pages and optimal
                 query I/O time {$O(\log_B n+t/B)$} and has {$O(\log_B
                 n+(\log_2Bn)/B)$} amortized insert I/O time. If the
                 order of the insertions is random then the expected
                 number of I/O operations needed to perform insertions
                 is reduced to {$O(\log_B n)$}. Indexing by one
                 attribute and by class name in an object-oriented
                 model, where objects are organized as a forest
                 hierarchy of classes, is also a special case of
                 external dynamic 2-dimensional range searching. Based
                 on this observation we first identify a simple
                 algorithm with good worst-case performance for the
                 class indexing problem. Using the forest structure of
                 the class hierarchy and techniques from the constraint
                 indexing problem, we improve its query I/O time from
                 {$O(\log_2c \log_B n + t/B)$} to {$O(logB +

                 schemas (dms), a model capturing the data manipulation
                 capabilities of a large class of deterministic methods

                 new construct is also relevant to query complexity. For

                 wireless communication channels. Palmtop based units
                 will often be disconnected for prolonged periods of
                 time due to the battery power saving measures; palmtops
                 will also frequently relocate between different cells
                 and connect to different data servers at different
                 times. Caching of frequently accessed data items will
                 be an important technique that will reduce contention
                 on the narrow bandwidth wireless channel. However,
                 cache invalidation strategies will be severely affected

                 uniformity distribution. Using measurements on real
                 data sets (road intersections of U.S. counties, star
                 coordinates from NASA's Infrared-Ultraviolet Explorer
                 etc.) we provide evidence that real data indeed are
                 skewed, and, moreover, we show that they behave as
                 mathematical fractals, with a measurable, non-integer
                 fractal dimension. \par

                 Armed with this tool, we then show its practical use in
                 predicting the performance of spatial access methods,
                 and specifically of the R-trees. We provide the {\em
                 first\/} analysis of R-trees for skewed distributions
                 of points: We develop a formula that estimates the
                 number of disk accesses for range queries, given only
                 the fractal dimension of the point set, and its count.
                 Experiments on real data sets show that the formula is
                 very accurate: the relative error is usually below 5%,
                 and it rarely exceeds 10%. \par

                 We believe that the fractal dimension will help replace
                 the uniformity and independence assumptions, allowing
                 more accurate analysis for {\em any\/} spatial access

                 hierarchies of objects to 3-sided, 2-dimensional
                 searching. {\em Path caching\/} is a new technique that

                 efficient data structures for internal 2-dimensional

                 These systems share some of common database issues with
                 conventional applications, but they also exhibit rather
                 unique characteristics that present challenging
                 database issues. Major DBMS issues for network
                 management include choosing the right data model,
                 handling two different kinds of data in terms of

                 cached pages and produce log records. The log records
                 are buffered locally in virtual storage and later sent
                 to the single log at the server. ARIES/CSA supports a

                 notion of parametrized constraints, which help us push
                 constraints with argument values that are known only at
                 run time, and develop techniques for pushing
                 parametrized constraints into predicate/view

                 parametrized constraints compiled in, and which can be
                 executed on systems, such as database query evaluation
                 systems, that do not handle full constraint solving.
                 Thereby our technique can push constraint selections

                 execution of global transactions in a distributed
                 database system. In a heterogeneous distributed
                 database (or multidatabase) environment, various local
                 sites make conflicting assertions of autonomy over the
                 execution of global transactions. A flexible

                 These dependencies are used to control the commitment
                 order of the subtransactions. We next identify those
                 restrictions that must be placed upon a flexible
                 transaction to ensure the maintenance of its
                 semi-atomicity. As atomicity is a restrictive

                 essential component of many application domains ranging
                 from library information systems to entertainment
                 technology. However, most implementations of these
                 systems cannot support the continuous display of
                 multimedia objects and suffer from frequent disruptions
                 and delays termed {\em hiccups}. This is due to the low
                 I/O bandwidth of the current disk technology, the high
                 bandwidth requirement of multimedia objects, and the
                 large size of these objects that almost always requires
                 them to be disk resident. One approach to resolve this
                 limitation is to decluster a multimedia object across
                 multiple disk drives in order to employ the aggregate
                 bandwidth of several disks to support the continuous
                 retrieval (and display) of objects. This paper
                 describes staggered striping as a novel technique to
                 provide effective support for multiple users accessing
                 the different objects in the database. Detailed

                 proteins, organisms, weather patterns, etc.) that
                 possess some important common externally observable
                 properties. You also have a structural description of
                 the entities (e.g., sequence, topological, or
                 geometrical data) and a distance metric. Combinatorial
                 pattern discovery is the activity of finding patterns
                 in the structural data that might explain these common
                 properties based on the metric. \par

                 This paper presents an example of combinatorial pattern
                 discovery: the discovery of patterns in protein
                 databases. The structural representation we consider
                 are strings and the distance metric is string edit
                 distance permitting variable length don't cares. Our
                 techniques incorporate string matching algorithms and
                 novel heuristics for discovery and optimization, most
                 of which generalize to other combinatorial structures.
                 Experimental results of applying the techniques to both
                 generated data and functionally related protein
                 families obtained from the Cold Spring Harbor
                 Laboratory show the effectiveness of the proposed
                 techniques. When we apply the discovered patterns to
                 perform protein classification, they give information
                 that is complementary to the best protein classifier
                 available today.",

                 Pragmatic considerations result in further constraints,
                 for instance, the existing log-based recovery
                 implementations that use before-images warrant that
                 transaction executions be strict. Strict executions are
                 restrictive, thus sacrificing concurrency and

                 particular, we propose a new inverse operation that can
                 be integrated with the underlying recovery mechanism.
                 In order to establish the viability of our approach, we
                 demonstrate the new implementation by making minor
                 modifications to the conventional recovery
                 architecture. This inverse operation is also designed

                 statements are almost never meticulously specified down
                 to very last detail. We ``fill in the gaps'' using our
                 common-sense knowledge about the world. We present a
                 powerful mechanism that allows users of object-oriented
                 database systems to specify certain types of ad-hoc
                 queries in a manner closer to the way we pose questions
                 to each other. Specifically, the system accepts as
                 input queries with incomplete, and therefore ambiguous,
                 path expressions. From them, it generates queries with
                 fully-specified path expressions that are consistent
                 with those given as input and capture what the user
                 most likely meant by them. This is achieved by mapping
                 the problem of path expression disambiguation to an
                 optimal path computation (in the transitive closure
                 sense) over a directed graph that represents the
                 schema. Our method works by exploiting the semantics of
                 the kinds of relationships in the schema and requires
                 no special knowledge about the contents of the
                 underlying database, i.e., it is domain independent. In
                 a limited set of experiments with human subjects, the

                 concurrency and allows interleavings among transactions
                 which are non-serializable, but which nonetheless
                 preserve the consistency of the database and are
                 acceptable to other users. We develop a graph-based
                 tool whose acyclicity is both a necessary and
                 sufficient condition for the correctness of an
                 execution. Our theory encompasses earlier proposals
                 that incorporate semantic information of transactions.
                 Furthermore it is the first approach that provides an
                 efficient graph based tool for recognizing correct
                 schedules without imposing any restrictions on the
                 application domain. Our approach is widely applicable
                 to many advanced database applications such as systems
                 with long-lived transactions and collaborative
                 environments.",

  abstract =     "Traditional query optimizers assume accurate knowledge
                 of run-time parameters such as selectivities and
                 resource availability during plan optimization, i.e.,
                 at compile time. In reality, however, this assumption
                 is often not justified. Therefore, the ``static'' plans
                 produced by traditional optimizers may not be optimal
                 for many of their actual run-time invocations. Instead,
                 we propose a novel optimization model that assigns the
                 bulk of the optimization effort to compile-time and
                 delays carefully selected optimization decisions until
                 run-time. Our previous work defined the run-time
                 primitives, ``dynamic plans'' using ``choose-plan''
                 operators, for executing such delayed decisions, but
                 did not solve the problem of constructing dynamic plans
                 at compile-time. The present paper introduces
                 techniques that solve this problem. Experience with a
                 working prototype optimizer demonstrates (i) that the
                 additional optimization and start-up overhead of
                 dynamic plans compared to static plans is dominated by
                 their advantage at run-time, (ii) that dynamic plans
                 are as robust as the ``brute-force'' remedy of run-time
                 optimization, i.e., dynamic plans maintain their
                 optimality even if parameters change between
                 compile-time and run-time, and (iii) that the start-up
                 overhead of dynamic plans is significantly less than
                 the time required for complete optimization at
                 run-time. In other words, our proposed techniques are
                 superior to both techniques considered to-date, namely
                 compile-time optimization into a single static plan as
                 well as run-time optimization. Finally, we believe that
                 the concepts and technology described can be
                 transferred to commercial query optimizers in order to
                 improve the performance of embedded queries with host
                 variables in the query predicate and to adapt to
                 run-time system loads unpredictable at compile time.",

                 collections. These languages may use set or bag
                 semantics and may be further complicated by the
                 presence of aggregate functions. We exhibit certain
                 classes of graphs and prove that the properties of
                 these graphs that can be tested in such languages are
                 either finite or cofinite. This result settles the
                 conjectures of Grumbach, Milo, and Paredaens that
                 parity test, transitive closure, and balanced binary
                 tree test are not expressible in bag languages like the
                 PTIME fragment of BALG of Grumbach and Milo and {\em
                 BQL \/} of Libkin and Wong. Moreover, it implies that
                 many recursive queries, including simple ones like the

                 relational language even when aggregate functions are

                 finite-cofiniteness result, we study the bounded degree
                 property which says that the number of distinct in- and

                 depend on the size of the input if the input is

                 filters, to improve parallel execution of hash joins.
                 We first present a scheme to transform a bushy
                 execution tree to an allocation tree, where each node
                 denotes a pipeline. Then, processors are allocated to
                 the nodes in the allocation tree based on the concept
                 of synchronous execution time such that inner relations

                 becomes prominent as the number of relations in a query

                 extensional database, a given predicate in a given
                 program has a finite number of derivations is called
                 the universal finiteness problem. The problem of
                 determining whether a given predicate in a given
                 program has a non-empty extension for some extensional
                 database is called the satisfiability problem. We show
                 that the universal finiteness problem can be reduced to
                 the satisfiability problem. Thus all decidability
                 results for satisfiability can be applied to universal
                 finiteness--for example, we can infer that the
                 universal finiteness problem is decidable for Datalog
                 extended with negation on base predicates. The
                 satisfiability problem can be easily reduced to the
                 universal finiteness problem, so that all
                 undecidability results for satisfiability can be
                 applied to universal finiteness. For example we can
                 infer that the universal finiteness problem is
                 undecidable for Datalog extended with stratified
                 negation. \par

                 Many recursive programs have infinite number of
                 derivations only when ed b relations have data cycles.
                 It is thus of particular interest to study universal
                 finiteness in the presence of acyclicity constraints on
                 the ed b relations. We define acyclicity constraints in
                 terms of non-satisfiability of a specific recursive
                 program. We show that both the problems of universal
                 finiteness and satisfiability of Datalog in the
                 presence of acyclicity constraints (on one or more ed b
                 relations) remain decidable for a language {$L$}
                 whenever the problems are decidable for language {$L$}
                 in absence of such constraints. We also show that the
                 problems are undecidable for arbitrary constraints

  abstract =     "Spatial joins are one of the most important operations
                 for combining spatial objects of several relations. In
                 this paper, spatial join processing is studied in
                 detail for extended spatial objects in two-dimensional
                 data space. We present an approach for spatial join
                 processing that is based on three steps. First, a
                 spatial join is performed on the minimum bounding
                 rectangles of the objects returning a set of
                 candidates. Various approaches for accelerating this
                 step of join processing have been examined at the last
                 year's conference [BKS 93a]. In this paper, we focus on
                 the problem how to compute the answers from the set of
                 candidate which is handled by the following two steps.
                 First of all, sophisticated approximations are used to
                 identify answers as well as to filter out false hits
                 from the set of candidates. For this purpose, we
                 investigate various types of conservative and
                 progressive approximations. In the last step, the exact
                 geometry of the remaining candidates has to be tested
                 against the join predicate. The time required for
                 computing spatial join predicates can essentially be
                 reduced when objects are adequately organized in main
                 memory. In our approach, objects are first decomposed
                 into simple components which are exclusively organized
                 by a main-memory resident spatial data structure.
                 Overall, we present a complete approach of spatial join
                 processing on complex spatial objects. The performance
                 of the individual steps of our approach is evaluated
                 with data sets from real cartographic applications. The
                 results show that our approach reduces the total
                 execution time of the spatial join by factors.",

                 This assumption is not realistic for applications
                 involving multiple map layer overlays or for queries
                 involving non-spatial selections. In this paper, we
                 explore a spatial join method that dynamically
                 constructs index trees called {\em seeded trees\/} at
                 join time. This methods uses knowledge of the data sets
                 involved in the join process. \par

                 Seeded trees are R-tree like structures, and are
                 divided into the {\em seed levels\/} and the {\em grown
                 levels}. The nodes in the seed levels are used to guide
                 tree growth during tree construction. The seed levels
                 can also be used to filter out some input data during
                 construction, thereby reducing tree size. We develop a
                 technique that uses intermediate linked lists during
                 tree construction and significantly speeds up the tree
                 construction process. The technique allows a large
                 number of random disk accesses during tree construction
                 to be replaced by smaller numbers of sequential
                 accesses. \par

                 Our performance studies show that spatial joins using
                 seeded trees outperform those using other methods
                 significantly in terms of disk I/O. The CPU penalties

                 complexity of checking--upon presentation of an entire
                 input--whether the input satisfies a certain property.
                 \par

                 For many, if not most, applications of computers
                 including: databases, text editors, program
                 development, it is more appropriate to model the
                 process as a dynamic one. There is a fairly large
                 object being worked on over a period of time. The
                 object is repeatedly modified by users and computations
                 are performed. \par

                 Thus a dynamic algorithm for a certain class of queries
                 is one that can maintain an input object, e.g., a
                 database, and process changes to the database as well
                 as answering queries about the current database.
                 \par

                 Here, we introduce the complexity class, Dynamic
                 First-Order Logic (Dyn-FO). This is the class of
                 properties S, for which there is an algorithm that can
                 perform inserts, deletes and queries from S, such that
                 each unit insert, delete, or query is first-order
                 computable. This corresponds to the sets of properties
                 that can be maintained and queried in first-order
                 logic, i.e., relational calculus, on a relational
                 database. \par

                 We investigate the complexity class Dyn-FO. We show
                 that many interesting properties are in Dyn-FO
                 including, among others, graph connectivity, k-edge
                 connectivity, and the computation of minimum spanning
                 trees. Furthermore, we show that several NP complete
                 optimization problems admit approximation algorithms in
                 Dyn-FO. Note that none of these problems is in static
                 FO, and this fact has been used to justify increasing
                 the power of query languages beyond first-order. It is
                 thus striking that these problems are indeed dynamic
                 first-order, and thus, were computable in first-order
                 database languages all along. \par

                 We also define ``bounded expansion reductions'' which
                 honor dynamic complexity classes. We prove that certain
                 standard complete problems for static complexity
                 classes, such as AGAP for P remain complete via these
                 new reductions. On the other hand, we prove that other
                 such problems including GAP for NL and 1GAP for L are
                 no longer complete via bounded expansion reductions.
                 Furthermore, we show that a version of AGAP called
                 AGAP+ is not in Dyn-FO unless all of P is contained in
                 parallel linear time. \par

                 object being worked on over a period of time. The
                 object is repeatedly modified by users and computations
                 are performed. Thus a dynamic algorithm for a certain
                 class of queries is one that can maintain an input
                 object, e.g. a database, and process changes to the
                 database as well as answering queries about the current
                 database. Here, we introduce the complexity class,
                 Dynamic First-Order Logic (Dyn-FO). This is the class
                 of properties S, for which there is an algorithm that
                 can perform inserts, deletes and queries from S, such
                 that each unit insert, delete, or query is first-order
                 computable. This corresponds to the sets of properties
                 that can be maintained and queried in first-order
                 logic, i.e. relational calculus, on a relational
                 database. We investigate the complexity class Dyn-FO.
                 We show that many interesting properties are in Dyn-FO
                 including, among others, graph connectivity, k-edge
                 connectivity, and the computation of minimum spanning
                 trees. Furthermore, we show that several NP complete
                 optimization problems admit approximation algorithms in
                 Dyn-FO. Note that none of these problems is in static
                 FO, and this fact has been used to justify increasing
                 the power of query languages beyond first-order. It is
                 thus striking that these problems are indeed dynamic
                 first-order, and thus, were computable in first-order
                 database languages all along. We also define ``bounded
                 expansion reductions'' which honor dynamic complexity
                 classes. We prove that certain standard complete
                 problems for static complexity classes, such as AGAP
                 for P remain complete via these new reductions. On the
                 other hand, we prove that other such problems including
                 GAP for NL and 1GAP for L are no longer complete via
                 bounded expansion reductions. Furthermore, we show that
                 a version of AGAP called AGAP+ is not in Dyn-FO unless
                 all of P is contained in parallel linear time. Our
                 results shed light on some of the interesting
                 differences between static and dynamic complexity.",

                 commodity memory, and arrays of SCSI disks, AlphaSort
                 runs the industry-standard sort benchmark in seven
                 seconds. This beats the best published record on a
                 32-cpu 32-disk Hypercube by 8:1. On another benchmark,
                 AlphaSort sorted more than a gigabyte in a minute.

                 AlphaSort is a cache-sensitive memory-intensive sort

                 nonbinary relations, and the possibility of expressing
                 cardinality constraints on attributes and relations. In
                 this paper we define a new data model, called {\em
                 CAR}, which extends the basic core of current
                 object-oriented data models with all the above
                 mentioned features. A technique is then presented both
                 for checking the consistency of class definitions, and
                 for computing the logical sequences of the knowledge
                 represented in the schema. Finally, the inherent
                 complexity of reasoning in {\em CAR\/} is investigated,
                 and the complexity of our inferencing technique is
                 studied, depending on various assumptions on the

                 for record-structured, disk-resident files with
                 key-based exact-match access. The file is organized
                 into buckets that are spread across multiple servers,
                 where a server may hold multiple buckets. Client
                 requests are serviced by mapping keys onto buckets and
                 looking up the corresponding server in an address
                 table. Dynamic growth in terms of file size and access
                 load is supported by bucket splits and migration onto
                 other existing or newly acquired servers. \par

                 The significant and challenging problem addressed here
                 is how to achieve scalability so that both the file
                 size and the client throughput can be scaled up by
                 linearly increasing the number of servers and
                 dynamically redistributing data. Unlike previous work
                 with similar objectives, our data redistribution
                 considers explicitly the cost/performance ratio of the
                 system by aiming to minimize the number of servers that
                 are acquired to provide the required performance. A new

                 utilization in the system does not drop below a
                 specified threshold. Preliminary simulation results

                 cost/performance is indeed achieved to a large

  abstract =     "We present a typed polymorphic calculus that supports
                 a general mechanism for view definition and object
                 sharing among classes. In this calculus, a class can
                 contain inclusion specifications of objects from other
                 classes. Each such specification consists of a {\em
                 predicate\/} determining the subset of objects to be
                 included and a {\em viewing function\/} under which
                 those included objects are manipulated. Both predicates
                 and viewing functions can be any type consistent
                 programs definable in the polymorphic calculus.
                 Inclusion specifications among classes can be cyclic,
                 allowing mutually recursive class definitions. These
                 features achieve flexible view definitions and wide
                 range of class organizations in a compact and elegant
                 way. Moreover, the calculus provides a suitable set of
                 operations for views and classes so that the programmer
                 can manipulate views and classes just the same way as
                 one deals with ordinary records and sets. \par

                 The proposed calculus uniformly integrates views and
                 classes in a polymorphic type system of a database
                 programming language similar to Machiavelli. The
                 calculus has a {\em type inference algorithm\/} that
                 relieves the programmer from complicated type
                 declarations of views and classes. The polymorphic type
                 system of the calculus is also shown to be sound, which
                 guarantees complete static check of type consistency of
                 programs involving classes and views. Through these
                 properties, the programmer can enjoy full advantages of
                 polymorphism and type inference when writing
                 object-oriented database programs.",

                 This provides an opportunity to satisfy the
                 increasingly tighter efficiency requirements by means
                 of distributed data structures. The design and analysis
                 of these structures under efficiency aspects, however,
                 has not yet been studied sufficiently. To our
                 knowledge, a single scalable, distributed data
                 structure has been proposed so far. It is a distributed
                 variant of linear hashing with uncontrolled splits,
                 and, as a consequence, performs efficiently for data
                 distributions that are close to uniform, but not
                 necessarily for others. In addition, it does not
                 support queries that refer to the linear order of keys,
                 such as nearest neighbor or range queries. We propose a
                 distributed search tree that avoids these problems,
                 since it inherits desirable properties from
                 non-distributed trees. Our experiments show that our
                 structure does indeed combine a guarantee for good
                 storage space utilization with high query efficiency.
                 Nevertheless, we feel that further research in the area
                 of scalable, distributed data structures is dearly
                 needed; it should eventually lead to a body of

                 level of abstraction of the underlying rule language.
                 The operational semantics of the rule language

                 components not only atomic values but also geometrical
                 figures. The model, which is inspired by the work of
                 Kanellakis, Kuper and Revesz on constraint query

                 Chandra and Harel's well-known consistency criterion
                 for classical relational queries is adapted. Various

                 addressed using a new dual-structure index. The index

                 about relations over strings of arbitrary length we
                 introduce alignment logic, a modal extension of
                 relational calculus. In addition to relations, a state
                 in the model consists of a two-dimensional array where
                 the strings are aligned on top of each other. The basic
                 modality in the language (a transpose, or ``slide'')
                 allows for a rearrangement of the alignment, and more
                 complex formulas can be formed using a syntax
                 reminiscent of regular expressions, in addition to the
                 usual connectives and quantifiers. It turns out that
                 the computational counterpart of the string-based
                 portion of the logic is the class of multitape two-way
                 finite state automata, which are devices particularly
                 well suited for the implementation of string matching.
                 A computational counterpart of the full logic is
                 obtained from relational algebra by extending the
                 selection operator into filters based on these
                 multitape machines. Safety of formulas in alignment
                 logic implies that new strings generated from old ones
                 have to be of bounded length. While an undecidable
                 property in general, this boundedness is decidable for
                 an important subclass of formulas. As far as expressive
                 power is concerned, alignment logic includes previous
                 proposals for querying string databases, and gives full
                 Turing computability. The language can be restricted to
                 define exactly regular sets and sets in the polynomial

                 technique is particularly useful for optimizing
                 selection predicates that contain terms whose
                 evaluation costs vary tremendously; e.g., the
                 evaluation of a nested subquery or the invocation of a
                 user-defined function in an object-oriented or extended
                 relational model may be orders of magnitude more
                 expensive than an attribute access (and comparison).
                 The idea of bypass processing consists of avoiding the
                 evaluation of such expensive terms whenever the outcome
                 of the entire selection predicate can already be
                 induced by testing other, less expensive terms. In
                 order to validate the viability of bypass evaluation,

                 query language of several major DBMSs, and it is
                 included in the proposed SQL2 standard draft. However,
                 ``associativity problems'' of the operator have been
                 pointed out since its introduction. In this paper we
                 propose a shift in the intuition behind outerjoin:
                 Instead of computing the join while also {\em
                 preserving\/} its arguments, outerjoin delivers tuples
                 that come {\em either\/} from the join {\em or\/} from
                 the arguments. Queries with joins and outerjoins
                 deliver tuples that come from one out of several joins,
                 where a single relation is a trivial join. An advantage
                 of this view is that, in contrast to preservation, {\em
                 disjunction\/} is commutative and associative, which is
                 a significant property for intuition, formalisms, and
                 generation of execution plans. \par

                 Based on a disjunctive normal form, we show that some
                 data merging queries cannot be evaluated by means of
                 binary outerjoins, and give alternative procedures to
                 evaluate those queries. We also explore several
                 evaluation strategies for outerjoin queries, including
                 the use of semijoin programs to reduce base
                 relations.",

                 efficiency, a number of existing object-oriented
                 database management systems are based on page server
                 architectures; data pages are their minimum unit of
                 transfer and client caching. Despite their efficiency,
                 page servers are often criticized as being too
                 restrictive when it comes to concurrency, as existing
                 systems use pages as the minimum locking unit as well.
                 In this paper we show how to support object-level
                 locking in a page server context. Several approaches
                 are described, including an adaptive granularity
                 approach that uses page-level locking for most pages
                 but switches to object-level locking when finer-grained
                 sharing is demanded. We study the performance of these
                 approaches, comparing them to both a pure page server
                 and a pure object server. For the range of workloads
                 that we have examined, our results indicate that a page
                 server is clearly preferable to an object server.
                 Moreover, the adaptive page server is shown to provide
                 very good performance, generally outperforming the pure
                 page server, the pure object server, and the other

                 typically large complex objects composed of many
                 interconnected heterogeneous objects, not thousands of
                 tuples. These applications may exhibit widely shifting
                 usage patterns due to their interactive mode of
                 operation. Such a class of applications would demand
                 clustering methods that are appropriate for clustering
                 large complex objects and that can adapt on-line to the
                 shifting usage patterns. While most object-oriented

                 (query) pattern within a specified tolerance. The idea

  abstract =     "This paper describes the XSB system, and its use as an
                 in-memory deductive database engine. XSB began from a
                 Prolog foundation, and traditional Prolog systems are
                 known to have serious deficiencies when used as
                 database systems. Accordingly, XSB has a fundamental
                 bottom-up extension, introduced through tabling (or
                 memoing)[4], which makes it appropriate as an
                 underlying query engine for deductive database systems.
                 Because it eliminates redundant computation, the
                 tabling extension makes XSB able to compute all
                 modularly stratified datalog programs finitely and with
                 polynomial data complexity. For non-stratified
                 programs, a meta-interpreter with the same properties
                 is provided. In addition XSB significantly extends and
                 improves the indexing capabilities over those of
                 standard Prolog. Finally, its syntactic basis in HiLog
                 [2], lends it flexibility for data modelling. \par

                 The implementation of XSB derives from the WAM [25],
                 the most common Prolog engine. XSB inherits the WAM's
                 efficiency and can take advantage of extensive compiler
                 technology developed for Prolog. As a result,
                 performance comparisons indicate that XSB is
                 significantly faster than other deductive database
                 systems for a wide range of queries and stratified rule
                 sets. XSB is under continuous development, and version
                 1.3 is available through anonymous ftp.",

                 transitive closure (reachability) algorithms for
                 databases. The study is based upon careful
                 implementations of the algorithms, measures page I/O,
                 and covers algorithms for full transitive closure as
                 well as {\em partial\/} transitive closure (finding all
                 successors of each node in a set of given source
                 nodes). We examine a wide range of acyclic graphs with
                 varying density and ``locality'' of arcs in the graph.
                 We also consider query parameters such as the
                 selectivity of the query, and system parameters such as
                 the buffer size and the page and successor list
                 replacement policies. We show that significant cost
                 tradeoffs exist between the algorithms in this spectrum
                 and identify the factors that influence the performance
                 of the algorithms. \par

                 An important aspect of our work is that we measure a
                 number of different cost metrics, giving us a good
                 understanding of the predictive power of these metrics
                 with respect to I/O cost. This is especially
                 significant since metrics such as number of tuples
                 generated or number of successor list operations have
                 been widely used to compare transitive closure
                 algorithms in the literature. Our results strongly
                 suggest that these other metrics cannot be reliability
                 used to predict I/O cost of transitive closure
                 evaluation.",

                 feeds, etc. The predominant user becomes the consumer.

                 $I_1$, $I_2$ then also $Q(I_1) = Q(I_2)$. Does this
                 imply that $Q$ can be rewritten as a query $Q_0$ that
                 only uses the views $V$?.\par

                 For first-order (FO) queries and view definitions over
                 possibly infinite databases, the answer is yes, as
                 follows from old results of Beth and Craig. We say that
                 FO is complete for FO-to-FO rewritings. However, Nash,
                 Segoufin and Vianu (2007) prove that if the query and
                 the view definitions are given by conjunctive queries,
                 then it might not be possible to formulate $Q'$ as a
                 conjunctive query. In other words, CQ is not complete
                 for CQ-to-CQ rewritings.\par

                 Here we consider queries and view definitions in the
                 packed fragment (PF) of first-order logic. This is a
                 generalization of the guarded fragment, a fragment of
                 particular interest to database theory. Gottlob et al.
                 2002 show that the guarded conjunctive queries are
                 exactly the acyclic queries. Leinders et al. 2005
                 characterize the entire guarded fragment by the
                 semijoin algebra.\par

                 We show that for both finite and unrestricted
                 databases, PF is complete for PF-to-PF rewritings. The
                 same holds for packed (unions of) conjunctive queries.
                 In both cases, we provide algorithms for testing
                 whether a query is determined by a set of views, and
                 for actually rewriting $Q$ to $Q'$. To compare: these
                 problems are undecidable for full FO, and still open
                 for conjunctive queries.",

                 for entity identification from a given relational
                 table. The input is a table containing information
                 about a set of entities over a fixed set of attributes
                 and a probability distribution over the set of entities
                 that specifies the likelihood of the occurrence of each
                 entity. The goal is to construct a decision tree that
                 identifies each entity unambiguously by testing the
                 attribute values such that the average number of tests
                 is minimized. This classical problem finds such diverse
                 applications as efficient fault detection, species
                 identification in biology, and efficient diagnosis in
                 the field of medicine. Prior work mainly deals with the
                 special case where the input table is binary and the
                 probability distribution over the set of entities is
                 uniform. We study the general problem involving
                 arbitrary input tables and arbitrary probability
                 distributions over the set of entities. We consider a
                 natural greedy algorithm and prove an approximation
                 guarantee of $O(r_K \log N)$, where $N$ is the number
                 of entities and $K$ is the maximum number of distinct
                 values of an attribute. The value $r_K$ is a suitably
                 defined Ramsey number, which is at most $\log K$. We

                 within a factor of $\Omega(\log N)$, even for binary
                 tables (i.e. $K = 2$). Thus, for the case of binary
                 tables, our approximation algorithm is optimal up to
                 constant factors (since $r_2 = 2$). In addition, our
                 analysis indicates a possible way of resolving a

                 about query containment in (fragments of) the richer

                 extensions of CoreXPath with the following operators,
                 which are all part of XPath 2.0 (except the last): path
                 intersection, path equality, path complementation,

                 generally describe the behaviors of a middleware
                 controller that builds an output tree iteratively,
                 issuing queries to a relational source and expanding
                 the tree with the query results at each step. To study
                 the complexity and expressive power of XML publishing
                 languages, this paper proposes a notion of publishing
                 transducers. Unlike automata for querying XML data, a
                 publishing transducer generates a new XML tree rather
                 than performing a query on an existing tree. We study a
                 variety of publishing transducers based on what
                 relational queries a transducer can issue, what
                 temporary stores a transducer can use during tree
                 generation, and whether or not some tree nodes are
                 allowed to be virtual, i.e., excluded from the output
                 tree. We first show how existing XML publishing
                 languages can be characterized by such transducers. We
                 then study the members ip, emptiness and equivalence
                 problems for various classes of transducers and
                 existing publishing languages. We establish lower and
                 upper bounds, all matching except one, ranging from
                 PTIME to undecidable. Finally, we investigate the
                 expressive power of these transducers and existing
                 languages. We show that when treated as relational
                 query languages, different classes of transducers
                 capture either complexity classes(e.g., PSPACE) or
                 fragments of datalog(e.g., linear datalog). For tree

                 on database sampling is large, there has been
                 relatively little work on the problem of maintaining a
                 sample in the presence of arbitrary insertions and
                 deletions to the underlying dataset. Most existing
                 maintenance techniques apply either to the insert-only
                 case or to datasets that do not contain duplicates. In
                 this paper, we provide a scheme that maintains a
                 Bernoulli sample of an underlying multiset in the
                 presence of an arbitrary stream of updates, deletions,
                 and insertions. Importantly, the scheme never needs to
                 access the underlying multiset. Such Bernoulli samples
                 are easy to manipulate, and are well suited to parallel
                 processing environments. Our method can be viewed as an
                 enhancement of the 'counting sample' scheme developed
                 by Gibbons and Matias for estimating the frequency of
                 highly frequent items. We show how the 'tracking
                 counters' used by our maintenance scheme can be
                 exploited to estimate population frequencies, sums, and
                 averages in an unbiased manner, with lower variance
                 than the usual estimators based on a Bernoulli sample.
                 The number of distinct items in the multiset can also
                 be estimated without bias. Finally, we discuss certain
                 problems of subsampling and merging that a rise in
                 systems with limited memory resources or distributed
                 processing, respectively.",

                 problem in data management and retrieval, with
                 applications in text and image search,in finding
                 similar objects and matching patterns. Here we study
                 cluster pruning, an extremely simple randomized
                 technique. During preprocessing we randomly choose a
                 subset of data points to be leaders the remaining data
                 points are partitioned by which leader is the closest.
                 For query processing, we find the leader(s) closest to
                 the query point. We then seek the nearest neighbors for
                 the query point among only the points in the clusters
                 of the closest leader(s). Recursion may be used in both
                 preprocessing and in search. Such schemes seek
                 approximate nearest neighbors that are 'almost as good'
                 as the nearest neighbors. How good are these
                 approximations and how much do they save in
                 computation.\par

                 Our contributions are: (1) we quantify metrics that
                 allow us to study the tradeoff between processing and
                 the quality of the approximate nearest neighbors; (2)
                 we give rigorous theoretical analysis of our schemes,
                 under natural generative processes (generalizing
                 Gaussian mixtures) for the data points; (3) experiments

                 we save orders of magnitude in query processing cost at
                 modest compromises in the quality of retrieved points.
                 In particular, we show that $p$-spheres, a
                 state-of-the-art solution, is outperformed by our

  abstract =     "Data exchange deals with the following problem: given
                 an instance over a source schema, a specification of
                 the relationship between the source and the target,and
                 dependencies on the target, construct an instance over
                 a target schema that satisfies the given relationships
                 and dependencies. Recently --- for data exchange
                 settings without target dependencies --- Libkin
                 (PODS'06) introduced a new concept of solutions based
                 on the closed world assumption (so-called
                 CWA-solutions), and showed that, in some respects, this
                 new notion behaves better than the standard notion of
                 solutions considered in previous papers on data
                 exchange. The present paper extends Libkin's notion of
                 CWA-solutions to data exchange settings with target
                 dependencies. We show that, when restricting attention
                 to data exchange settings with weakly acyclic target
                 dependencies, this new notion behaves similarly as
                 before: the core is the unique 'minimal' CWA-solution,
                 and computing CWA-solutions as well as certain answers
                 to positive queries is possible in polynomial time and
                 can be PTIME-hard. However, there may be more than one
                 'maximal' CWA-solution. And going beyond the class of
                 positive queries, we obtain that there are conjunctive
                 queries with (just) one inequality, for which
                 evaluating the certain answers is coNP-hard. Finally,
                 we consider the EXISTENCE-OF-CWA-SOLUTIONS problem:
                 while the problem is tractable for data exchange
                 settings with weakly acyclic target dependencies, it
                 turns out to be undecidable for general data exchange
                 settings. As a consequence, we obtain that also the
                 EXISTENCE-OF-UNIVERSAL-SOLUTIONS problem is undecidable
                 in genera.",

  abstract =     "Schema mappings are high-level specifications that
                 describe the relationship between two database schemas.
                 Two operators on schema mappings, namely the
                 composition operator and the inverse operator, are
                 regarded as especially important. Progress on the study
                 of the inverse operator was not made until very
                 recently, as even finding the exact semantics of this
                 operator turned out to be a fairly delicate task.
                 Furthermore, this notion is rather restrictive, since
                 it is rare that a schema mapping possesses an
                 inverse.\par

                 In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of a
                 quasi-inverse of a schema mapping. This notion is a
                 principled relaxation of the notion of an inverse of a
                 schema mapping; intuitively, it is obtained from the
                 notion of an inverse by not differentiating between
                 instances that are equivalent for data-exchange
                 purposes. For schema mappings specified by
                 source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies ($s$-$t$
                 tgds), we give a necessary and sufficient combinatorial
                 condition for the existence of a quasi-inverse, and
                 then use this condition to obtain both positive and
                 negative results about the existence of quasi-inverses.
                 In particular, we show that every LAV (local-as-view)
                 schema mapping has a quasi-inverse, but that there are
                 schema mappings specified by full $s$-$t$ tgds that
                 have no quasi-inverse. After this, we study the
                 language needed to express quasi-inverses of schema
                 mappings specified by $s$-$t$ tgds, and we obtain a
                 complete characterization. We also characterize the
                 language needed to express inverses of schema mappings,
                 and thereby solve a problem left open in the earlier
                 study of the inverse operator. Finally, we show that
                 quasi-inverses can be used in many cases to recover the
                 data that was exported by the original schema mapping
                 when performing data exchange.",

  abstract =     "Data exchange and virtual data integration have been
                 the subject of several investigations in the recent
                 literature. At the same time, the notion of peer data
                 management has emerged as a powerful abstraction of
                 many forms of flexible and dynamic data-centered
                 distributed systems. Although research on the above
                 issues has progressed considerably in the last years, a
                 clear understanding on how to combine data exchange and
                 data integration in peer data management is still
                 missing. This is the subject of the present paper. We
                 start our investigation by first proposing a novel
                 framework for peer data exchange, showing that it is a
                 generalization of the classical data exchange setting.
                 We also present algorithms for all the relevant data
                 exchange tasks, and show that they can all be done in
                 polynomial time with respect to data complexity. Based
                 on the motivation that typical mappings and integrity
                 constraints found in data integration are not captured
                 by peer data exchange, we extend the framework to
                 incorporate these features. One of the main
                 difficulties is that the constraints of this new class
                 are not amenable to materialization. We address this
                 issue by resorting to a suitable combination of virtual
                 and materialized data exchange, showing that the
                 resulting framework is a generalization of both
                 classical data exchange and classical data integration,
                 and that the new setting incorporates the most
                 expressive types of mapping and constraints considered
                 in the two contexts. Finally, we present algorithms for
                 all the relevant data management tasks also in the new
                 setting, and show that, again, their data complexity is
                 polynomial.",

                 have proved to be key concepts in establishing
                 fixed-para-meter tractability results. Indeed, by
                 Courcelle's Theorem we know: Any property of finite
                 structures, which is expressible by an MSO sentence,
                 can be decided in linear time (data complexity) if the
                 structures have bounded treewidth.\par

                 In principle, Courcelle's Theorem can be applied
                 directly to construct concrete algorithms by
                 transforming the MSO evaluation problem into a tree
                 language recognition problem. The latter can then be
                 solved via a finite tree automaton (FTA). However, this
                 approach has turned out to be problematical, since even
                 relatively simple MSO formulae may lead to a 'state
                 explosion' of the FTA.\par

                 In this work we propose monadic datalog (i.e., data log
                 where all intentional predicate symbols are unary) as
                 an alternative method to tackle this class of
                 fixed-parameter tractable problems. We show that if
                 some property of finite structures is expressible in
                 MSO then this property can also be expressed by means
                 of a monadic datalog program over the structure plus
                 the tree decomposition. Moreover, we show that the
                 resulting fragment of datalog can be evaluated in
                 linear time (both w.r.t. the program size and w.r.t.
                 the data size). This new approach is put to work by
                 devising a new algorithm for the PRIMALITY problem
                 (i.e., testing if some attribute in a relational schema

                 value summarizations. We define them via a declarative,
                 rule-based language with shape-membership constraints
                 in its rule bodies and subscripting and aggregation in
                 its rule heads. We explore safety (including bounds
                 analysis) and query equivalence for various subclasses
                 divided according to the aggregator type, whether we
                 allow disjunctions, and whether we allow (limited)
                 Presburger arithmetic in index and shape terms. We show
                 safety is tractable in the nonarithmetic cases, while
                 state safety remains in $P$ in the arithmetic ones. We
                 show that, for a class of monoid-based set and bag
                 aggregators, equivalence reduces to equivalence of
                 index-cores --- core queries collecting array indices
                 rather than values. Forset-aggregator queries, we give
                 complete characterizations of equivalence in terms of
                 containment maps and show the equivalence problems are
                 in $P$ in the nonarithmetic, conjunctive case and in

                 explored from a database perspective, non-linear
                 prefixes have not-most likely because of complexity
                 concerns. In this paper we first illustrate the
                 usefulness of non-linear prefixes in query languages by
                 means of example queries. We then introduce the subject
                 formally, distinguishing between two forms of
                 non-linearity: branching and cumulation. To escape
                 complexity concerns, we focus on monadic quantifiers.
                 In this context, we show that branching does not extend
                 the expressive power of first order logic when it is
                 interpreted over finite models, while cumulation does
                 not extend the expressive power when it is interpreted

                 data, where each item of the stream represents a
                 probability distribution over a set of possible events.
                 Therefore, a probabilistic stream determines a
                 distribution over a potentially exponential number of
                 classical 'deterministic' streams where each item is
                 deterministically one of the domain

                 Designing efficient aggregation algorithms for
                 probabilistic data is crucial for handling uncertainty
                 in data-centric applications such as OLAP. Such

                 Applying this approach, we extend a classical data

                 ranging from managing events from RFID readers to
                 monitoring RSS feeds. Consequently, there exists much
                 work on them in the literature. The prevalent use of
                 these systems is on-line recognition of patterns that
                 are sequences of correlated events in event streams.
                 Query semantics and implementation efficiency are
                 inherently determined by the underlying temporal model:
                 how events are sequenced (what is the 'next' event),
                 and how the time stamp of an event is represented. Many
                 competing temporal models for event systems have been
                 proposed, with no consensus on which approach is
                 best.\par

                 We take a foundational approach to this problem. We
                 create a formal framework and present event system
                 design choices as axioms. The axioms are grouped into
                 standard axioms and desirable axioms. Standard axioms
                 are common to the design of all event systems.
                 Desirable axioms are not always satisfied, but are
                 useful for achieving high performance. Given these
                 axioms, we prove several important results. First, we
                 show that there is a unique model up to isomorphism
                 that satisfies the standard axioms and supports
                 associativity, so our axioms are a sound and complete
                 axiomatization of associative time stamps in event

                 so again our axiomatization is sound and complete. We
                 believe this model is ideally suited to be the standard
                 temporal model for complex event processing.",

                 statistics, the format of reported data for the US
                 Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Internal
                 Revenue Service. In many settings such as these privacy
                 is not only ethically mandated, but frequently legally
                 as well. Consequently there is an extensive and diverse
                 literature dedicated to the problems of statistical
                 disclosure control in contingency table release.
                 However, all current techniques for reporting
                 contingency tables fall short on at least one of
                 privacy, accuracy, and consistency (among multiple
                 released tables). We propose a solution that provides
                 strong guarantees for all three desiderata
                 simultaneously.\par

                 Our approach can be viewed as a special case of a more
                 general approach for producing synthetic data: Any
                 privacy-preserving mechanism for contingency table
                 release begins with raw data and produces a (possibly
                 inconsistent) privacy-preserving set of marginals. From
                 these tables alone-and hence without weakening
                 privacy--we will find and output the 'nearest'
                 consistent set of marginals. Interestingly, this set is
                 no farther than the tables of the raw data, and
                 consequently the additional error introduced by the
                 imposition of consistency is no more than the error
                 introduced by the privacy mechanism itself.\par

                 The privacy mechanism of [20] gives the strongest known
                 privacy guarantees, with very little error. Combined
                 with the techniques of the current paper, we therefore
                 obtain excellent privacy, accuracy, and consistency
                 among the tables. Moreover, our techniques are
                 surprisingly efficient. Our techniques apply equally
                 well to the logical cousin of the contingency table,
                 the OLAP cube.",

                 probabilistic data is to evaluate relational queries
                 and then calculate the probability of each tuple in the
                 result. This approach ignores the possibility that the
                 probabilities of complete answers are too low and,
                 hence, partial answers (with sufficiently high
                 probabilities) become important. Therefore, we consider
                 the semantics in which answers are maximal (i.e., have
                 the smallest degree of incompleteness), subject to the
                 constraint that the probability is still above a given

                 We investigate the complexity of joining relations
                 under the above semantics. In contrast to the
                 deterministic case, this approach gives rise to two
                 different enumeration problems. The first is finding
                 all maximal sets of tuples that are join consistent,
                 connected and have a joint probability above the

                 answers and then choose the maximal ones among those
                 with probabilities above the threshold. We give
                 efficient algorithms for several, important special

                 reference shelves of libraries --- dictionaries,
                 encyclopedias, gazetteers etc. --- are now curated
                 databases. Since it is now easy to publish databases on
                 the web, there has been an explosion in the number of
                 new curated databases used in scientific research. The
                 value of curated databases lies in the organization and
                 the quality of the data they contain. Like the paper
                 reference works they have replaced, they usually
                 represent the efforts of a dedicated group of people to
                 produce a definitive description of some subject

                 Curated databases present a number of challenges for
                 database research. The topics of annotation,

                 include data from, other databases, and much of the
                 work of a curator is annotating existing data.
                 Evolution of structure is important because these
                 databases often evolve from semistructured
                 representations, and because they have to accommodate
                 new scientific discoveries. Much of the work in these
                 areas is in its infancy, but it is beginning to provide
                 suggest new research for both theory and practice. We

                 data from a source schema is to be mapped to a target
                 schema. Once the data has been transferred from the
                 source to the target, a natural question is whether one
                 can undo the process and recover the initial data, or
                 at least part of it. In fact, it would be desirable to
                 find a reverse schema mapping from target to source
                 that specifies how to bring the exchanged data
                 back.\par

                 In this paper, we introduce the notion of a recovery of
                 a schema mapping: it is a reverse mapping $M'$ for a
                 mapping $M$ that recovers sound data with respect to
                 $M$. We further introduce an order relation on
                 recoveries. This allows us to choose mappings that
                 recover the maximum amount of sound information. We
                 call such mappings maximum recoveries. We study maximum
                 recoveries in detail, providing a necessary and
                 sufficient condition for their existence. In
                 particular, we prove that maximum recoveries exist for
                 the class of mappings specified by FO-to-CQ
                 source-to-target dependencies. This class subsumes the
                 class of source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies
                 used in previous work on data exchange. For the class
                 of mappings specified by FO-to-CQ dependencies, we
                 provide an exponential-time algorithm for computing
                 maximum recoveries, and a simplified version for full
                 dependencies that works in quadratic time. We also
                 characterize the language needed to express maximum
                 recoveries, and we include a detailed comparison with
                 the notion of inverse (and quasi-inverse) mapping
                 previously proposed in the data exchange literature. In
                 particular, we show that maximum recoveries strictly

                 describes the relationship between two database
                 schemas. As schema mappings constitute the essential
                 building blocks of data exchange and data integration,
                 an extensive investigation of the foundations of schema
                 mappings has been carried out in recent years. Even
                 though several different aspects of schema mappings
                 have been explored in considerable depth, the study of
                 schema-mapping optimization remains largely uncharted
                 territory to date.\par

                 In this paper, we lay the foundation for the
                 development of a theory of schema-mapping optimization.
                 Since schema mappings are constructs that live at the
                 logical level of information integration systems, the
                 first step is to introduce concepts and to develop
                 techniques for transforming schema mappings to
                 'equivalent' ones that are more manageable from the
                 standpoint of data exchange or of some other data
                 interoperability task. In turn, this has to start by
                 introducing and studying suitable notions of
                 'equivalence' between schema mappings. To this effect,
                 we introduce the concept of data-exchange equivalence
                 and the concept of conjunctive-query equivalence. These
                 two concepts of equivalence are natural relaxations of
                 the classical notion of logical equivalence; the first
                 captures indistinguishability for data-exchange
                 purposes, while the second captures
                 indistinguishability for conjunctive-query-answering
                 purposes. Moreover, they coincide with logical
                 equivalence on schema mappings specified by
                 source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies ($s$-$t$
                 tgds), but differ on richer classes of dependencies,
                 such as second-order tuple-generating dependencies (SO
                 tgds) and sets of $s$-$t$ tgds and target
                 tuple-generating dependencies (target tgds).\par

                 After exploring the basic properties of these three

                 focus on the following question: under what conditions
                 is a schema mapping conjunctive-query equivalent to a
                 schema mapping specified by a finite set of $s$-$t$
                 tgds? We answer this question by obtaining complete
                 characterizations for schema mappings that are
                 specified by an SO tgd and for schema mappings that are
                 specified by a finite set of $s$-$t$ tgds and target
                 tgds, and have terminating chase. These
                 characterizations involve boundedness properties of the
                 cores of universal solutions.",

                 thorough analysis of such rank join algorithms. A

                 conjunction of boolean filters, and each filter could
                 be shared across multiple queries. We are required to
                 design an evaluation plan that evaluates filters
                 against stream items in order to determine the set of
                 queries satisfied by each item. The evaluation plan
                 specifies for each item: (i) the subset of filters

                 evaluations, and (ii) the processor on which each

                 Filter ordering has received extensive attention in
                 single-processor settings, with the objective of
                 minimizing the total cost of filter evaluations: in
                 particular, efficient (approximation) algorithms are
                 known for various important versions of min-cost filter
                 ordering. Min-cost filter ordering problem for a single
                 processor is a special case of our flow maximization
                 for parallel processors. Our main contribution in this
                 work is a generic flow-maximization algorithm, which
                 assumes the availability of a min-cost filter ordering
                 algorithm for a single processor, and uses this to
                 iteratively construct a solution to the
                 flow-maximization problem for heterogeneous parallel
                 processors. We show that the approximation ratio of our
                 flow-maximization strategy is essentially the same as
                 that of the underlying min-cost filter ordering
                 algorithm. Our result, along with existing results on

                 of sequential events such as stock feeds, sensor
                 readings, or IP traffic measurements, data tuples
                 pertaining to recent events are typically more
                 important than older ones. This can be formalized via
                 time-decay functions, which assign weights to data
                 based on the age of data. Decay functions such as
                 sliding windows and exponential decay have been studied
                 under the assumption of well-ordered arrivals, i.e.,
                 data arrives in non-decreasing order of time stamps.
                 However, data quality issues are prevalent in massive
                 streams (due to network asynchrony and delays etc.),

                 and experimentally. Our experiments confirm that these
                 algorithms can be applied in practice, and compare the

                 been extensively investigated in recent years. One main
                 direction of research has focused on the semantics and
                 the complexity of answering first-order queries in the
                 context of data exchange between relational schemas. In
                 this paper, we initiate a systematic investigation of
                 the semantics and the complexity of aggregate queries
                 in data exchange, and make a number of conceptual and
                 technical contributions. Data exchange is a context in
                 which incomplete information arises, hence one has to
                 cope with a set of possible worlds, instead of a single
                 database. Three different sets of possible worlds have
                 been explored in the study of the certain answers of
                 first-order queries in data exchange: the set of
                 possible worlds of all solutions, the set of possible
                 worlds of all universal solutions, and a set of
                 possible worlds derived from the CWA-solutions. We
                 examine each of these sets and point out that none of
                 them is suitable for aggregation in data exchange, as
                 each gives rise to rather trivial semantics. Our
                 analysis also reveals that, to have meaningful
                 semantics for aggregation in data exchange, a strict
                 closed world assumption has to be adopted in selecting
                 the set of possible worlds. For this, we introduce and
                 study the set of the endomorphic images of the
                 canonical universal solution as a set of possible
                 worlds for aggregation in data exchange. Our main
                 technical result is that for schema mappings specified
                 by source-to-target tgds, there are polynomial-time
                 algorithms for computing the range semantics of every
                 scalar aggregation query, where the range semantics of
                 an aggregate query is the greatest lower bound and the
                 least upper bound of the values that the query takes
                 over the set of possible worlds. Among these
                 algorithms, the more sophisticated one is the algorithm
                 for the average operator, which makes use of concepts
                 originally introduced in the study of the core of the
                 universal solutions in data exchange. We also show that
                 if, instead of range semantics, we consider possible
                 answer semantics, then it is an NP-complete problem to
                 tell if a number is a possible answer of a given scalar
                 aggregation query with the average operator.",

                 closed-world semantics only moves 'as much data as
                 needed' from the source to the target to satisfy
                 constraints of a schema mapping. It avoids some of the
                 problems exhibited by the open-world semantics, but
                 limits the expressivity of schema mappings. Here we
                 propose a mixed approach: one can designate different
                 attributes of target schemas as open or closed, to
                 combine the additional expressivity of the open-world
                 semantics with the better behavior of query answering

                 of decidability of termination of the standard chase,

                 are strictly less over-conservative than the best
                 previously known. We investigate the adequacy of the
                 standard chase for checking query containment under
                 constraints, constraint implication and computing
                 certain answers in data exchange, gaining a deeper
                 understanding by separating the algorithm from its
                 result. We identify the properties of the chase result
                 that are essential to the above applications, and we
                 introduce the more general notion of $F$-universal

  abstract =     "We present a novel definition of privacy in the
                 framework of offline (retroactive) database query
                 auditing. Given information about the database, a
                 description of sensitive data, and assumptions about
                 users' prior knowledge, our goal is to determine if
                 answering a past user's query could have led to a
                 privacy breach. According to our definition, an audited
                 property $A$ is private, given the disclosure of
                 property $B$, if no user can gain confidence in $A$ by
                 learning $B$, subject to prior knowledge constraints.
                 Privacy is not violated if the disclosure of $B$ causes
                 a loss of confidence in $A$. The new notion of privacy
                 is formalized using the well-known semantics for
                 reasoning about knowledge, where logical properties
                 correspond to sets of possible worlds (databases) that
                 satisfy these properties. Database users are modelled
                 as either possibilistic agents whose knowledge is a set
                 of possible worlds, or as probabilistic agents whose
                 knowledge is a probability distribution on possible
                 worlds.\par

                 We analyze the new privacy notion, show its
                 relationship with the conventional approach, and derive
                 criteria that allow the auditor to test privacy
                 efficiently in some important cases. In particular, we
                 prove characterization theorems for the possibilistic
                 case, and study in depth the probabilistic case under
                 the assumption that all database records are considered
                 a-priori independent by the user, as well as under more
                 relaxed (or absent) prior-knowledge assumptions. In the
                 probabilistic case we show that for certain families of
                 distributions there is no efficient algorithm to test
                 whether an audited property $A$ is private given the
                 disclosure of a property $B$, assuming P $\neq$ NP.
                 Nevertheless, for many interesting families, such as
                 the family of product distributions, we obtain

                 appropriate natural generalizations of standard
                 clustering optimization criteria. Two variations arise,

                 Specifically, we look at data objects that are
                 represented using leaf-labeled trees denoting a set of
                 elements at the leaves organized in a hierarchy. Such
                 representations are richer alternatives to a set. For
                 example, a document can be represented as a hierarchy
                 of sets wherein chapters, sections, and paragraphs
                 represent different levels in the hierarchy. Such a
                 representation is richer than viewing the document
                 simply as a set of words. We measure distance between
                 trees using the best possible super-imposition that
                 minimizes the number of mismatched leaf labels. Our
                 distance measure is equivalent to an Earth Mover's
                 Distance measure since the leaf-labeled trees of height
                 one can be viewed as sets and can be recursively
                 extended to trees of larger height by viewing them as

                 tailored to data-intensive, distributed, dynamic Web
                 services. Active XML is based on XML documents with
                 embedded function calls. The state of a document
                 evolves depending on the result of internal function
                 calls (local computations) or external ones
                 (interactions with users or other services). Function
                 calls return documents that may be active, so may
                 activate new subtasks. The focus of the paper is on the

                 Web services (ASTs) to specify the behaviors of the
                 services. Upon receiving a sequence of input messages,
                 an AST issues multiple queries to a database and
                 generates actions, in parallel; it produces external
                 messages and database updates by synthesizing the
                 actions parallely generated. In contrast to previous
                 models for Web services, ASTs advocate parallel
                 processing and (deterministic) synthesis of actions. We
                 classify ASTs based on what queries an AST can issue,
                 how the synthesis of actions is expressed, and whether

                 the requester. This paper considers such networks and
                 aims to maximize the probability of successful search.
                 Prior work along these lines has analyzed the optimal
                 degrees of replication for data items with non-uniform
                 but global request rates, but did not address the issue
                 of where replicas should be placed and was very limited

                 dynamics of network and workload.\par

                 This paper presents the integrated P2R2 algorithm for

                 successful-search probability that is within a factor
                 of 2 of the optimal solution. The algorithm is
                 efficient and can handle workload evolution. We prove
                 that, whenever the access patterns are in steady state,
                 our algorithm converges to the desired near-optimal
                 placement. We further show by simulations that the

                 the distributed evaluation of functions. The goal is to
                 determine the value of a function over a set of
                 distributed inputs, in a communication efficient
                 manner. Specifically, we assume that each node holds a
                 time varying input vector, and we are interested in
                 determining, at any given time, whether the value of an
                 arbitrary function on the average of these vectors
                 crosses a predetermined threshold.\par

                 In this paper, we introduce a new method for monitoring
                 distributed data, which we term shape sensitive
                 geometric monitoring. It is based on a geometric
                 interpretation of the problem, which enables to define
                 local constraints on the data received at the nodes. It
                 is guaranteed that as long as none of these constraints
                 has been violated, the value of the function does not
                 cross the threshold. We generalize previous work on
                 geometric monitoring, and solve two problems which
                 seriously hampered its performance: as opposed to the
                 constraints used so far, which depend only on the
                 current values of the local input vectors, here we
                 incorporate their temporal behavior into the
                 constraints. Also, the new constraints are tailored to
                 the geometric properties of the specific function which
                 is being monitored, while the previous constraints were
                 generic.\par

                 Experimental results on real world data reveal that
                 using the new geometric constraints reduces
                 communication by up to three orders of magnitude in
                 comparison to existing approaches, and considerably
                 narrows the gap between existing results and a newly
                 defined lower bound on the communication complexity.",

                 hypertree-width, allow polynomial time evaluations. We
                 extend the framework in the presence of functional
                 dependencies. Our extended CQ evaluation problem has a
                 concise equivalent formulation in terms of the
                 homomorphism problem (HOM) for non-relational
                 structures. We introduce the notions of 'closure
                 tree-width' and 'hyperclosure tree-width' for arbitrary
                 structures, and we prove that HOM (and hence CQ)
                 restricted to bounded (hyper)closure tree-width becomes
                 tractable. There are classes of structures with bounded

                 according to a high-level specification called a
                 schema-mapping while preserving the information encoded
                 in a source database. This paper introduces a notion of
                 generalized schema-mapping that enriches the standard
                 schema-mappings (as defined by Fagin et al) with more
                 expressive power. It then proposes a more general and
                 arguably more intuitive notion of semantics that rely
                 on three criteria: Soundness, Completeness and
                 Laconicity (non-redundancy and minimal size). These
                 semantics are shown to coincide precisely with the
                 notion of cores of universal solutions in the framework
                 of Fagin, Kolaitis and Popa. It is also well-defined
                 and of interest for larger classes of schema-mappings
                 and more expressive source databases (with null-values
                 and equality constraints). After an investigation of
                 the key properties of generalized schema-mappings and
                 their semantics, a criterion called Termination of the
                 Oblivious Chase (TOC) is identified that ensures
                 polynomial data-complexity. This criterion strictly
                 generalizes the previously known criterion of
                 Weak-Acyclicity. To prove the tractability of TOC
                 schema-mappings, a new polynomial time algorithm is
                 provided that, unlike the algorithm of Gottlob and Nash
                 from which it is inspired, does not rely on the
                 syntactic property of Weak-Acyclicity. As the problem
                 of deciding whether a Schema-mapping satisfies the TOC
                 criterion is only recursively enumerable, a more
                 restrictive criterion called Super-weak Acylicity (SwA)
                 is identified that can be decided in Polynomial-time
                 while generalizing substantially the notion of

  abstract =     "An inverse of a schema mapping $M$ is intended to
                 `undo' what $M$ does, thus providing a way to perform
                 `reverse' data exchange. In recent years, three
                 different formalizations of this concept have been
                 introduced and studied, namely, the notions of an
                 inverse of a schema mapping, a quasi-inverse of a
                 schema mapping, and a maximum recovery of a schema
                 mapping. The study of these notions has been carried
                 out in the context in which source instances are
                 restricted to consist entirely of constants, while
                 target instances may contain both constants and labeled
                 nulls. This restriction on source instances is crucial
                 for obtaining some of the main technical results about
                 these three notions, but, at the same time, limits
                 their usefulness, since reverse data exchange naturally
                 leads to source instances that may contain both
                 constants and labeled nulls.\par

                 We develop a new framework for reverse data exchange
                 that supports source instances that may contain nulls,
                 thus overcoming the semantic mismatch between source
                 and target instances of the previous formalizations.
                 The development of this new framework requires a
                 careful reformulation of all the important notions,
                 including the notions of the identity schema mapping,
                 inverse, and maximum recovery. To this effect, we
                 introduce the notions of extended identity schema
                 mapping, extended inverse, and maximum extended
                 recovery, by making systematic use of the homomorphism
                 relation on instances. We give results concerning the
                 existence of extended inverses and of maximum extended
                 recoveries, and results concerning their applications
                 to reverse data exchange and query answering. Moreover,
                 we show that maximum extended recoveries can be used to
                 capture in a quantitative way the amount of information
                 loss embodied in a schema mapping specified by
                 source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies.",

                 studied in connection with data integration and
                 exchange problems, but mappings between XML schemas
                 have not received the same amount of attention. Our
                 goal is to develop a theory of expressive XML schema
                 mappings. Such mappings should be able to use various
                 forms of navigation in a document, and specify
                 conditions on data values. We develop a language for
                 XML schema mappings, and concentrate on three types of
                 problems: static analysis of mappings, their
                 complexity, and their composition. We look at static
                 analysis problems related to various flavors of
                 consistency: for example, whether it is possible to map
                 some document of a source schema into a document of the
                 target schema, or whether all documents of a source
                 schema can be mapped. We classify the complexity of
                 these problems. We then move to the complexity of
                 mappings themselves, i.e., recognizing pairs of
                 documents such that one can be mapped into the other,
                 and provide a classification based on sets of features
                 used in mappings. Finally we look at composition of XML
                 schema mappings. We study its complexity and show that
                 it is harder to achieve closure under composition for
                 XML than for relational mappings. Nevertheless, we find
                 a robust class of XML schema mappings that have good
                 complexity properties and are closed under
                 composition.",

                 of $Q$, both in the absence and in the presence of keys

                 a novel `coloring' of the query variables that
                 associates a {\em coloring number\/} $C(Q)$ to each

                 between Web components exchanging flows of information.
                 Such a situation arises for instance in mashup systems
                 [22] or when monitoring distributed autonomous systems
                 [6]. This is a challenging problem that has generated
                 recently a lot of attention; see Web 2.0 [38]. For
                 capturing interactions between Web components, we use
                 active documents interacting with the rest of the world
                 via streams of updates. Their input streams specify
                 updates to the document (in the spirit of RSS feeds),
                 whereas their output streams are defined by queries on
                 the document. In most of the paper, the focus is on
                 input streams where the updates are only insertions,
                 although we do consider also deletions.\par

                 We introduce and study two fundamental concepts in this
                 setting, namely, satisfiability and relevance. Some
                 fact is {\em satisfiable\/} for an active document and
                 a query if it has a chance to be in the result of the
                 query in some future state. Given an active document
                 and a query, a call in the document is {\em relevant\/}
                 if the data brought by this call has a chance to impact
                 the answer to the query. We analyze the complexity of
                 computing satisfiability in our core model (insertions
                 only) and for extensions (e.g., with deletions). We
                 also analyze the complexity of computing relevance in
                 the core model.",

  abstract =     "The paper investigates the question of whether a
                 partially closed database has complete information to
                 answer a query. In practice an enterprise often
                 maintains master data Dm, a closed-world database. We
                 say that a database D is partially closed if it
                 satisfies a set V of containment constraints of the
                 form `q(D) is a subset of p(Dm)', where q is a query in
                 a language Lc and p is a projection query. The part of
                 D not constrained by (Dm,V) is open, from which some
                 tuples may be missing. The database D is said to be
                 complete for a query Q relative to (Dm,V) if for all
                 partially closed extensions D' of D, Q(D')=Q(D), i.e.,
                 adding tuples to D either violates some constraints in
                 V or does not change the answer to Q.\par

                 We first show that the proposed model can also capture
                 the consistency of data, in addition to its relative
                 completeness. Indeed, integrity constraints studied for
                 consistency can be expressed as containment
                 constraints. We then study two problems. One is to
                 decide, given Dm, V, a query Q in a language Lq and a
                 partially closed database D, whether D is complete for
                 Q relative to (Dm,V). The other is to determine, given
                 Dm, V and Q, whether there exists a partially closed
                 database that is complete for Q relative to (Dm,V). We
                 establish matching lower and upper bounds on these
                 problems for a variety of languages Lq and Lc. We also
                 provide characterizations for a database to be
                 relatively complete, and for a query to allow a
                 relatively complete database, when Lq and Lc are

                 containing relationships. A social network is a prime
                 example of such data, where the nodes represent
                 individuals and edges represent relationships. Nearly
                 all interesting queries over social networks involve
                 joins, and for such queries, existing output
                 perturbation algorithms severely distort query answers.
                 We propose an algorithm that significantly improves
                 utility over competing techniques, typically reducing
                 the error bound from polynomial in the number of nodes
                 to polylogarithmic. The algorithm is, to the best of

                 particular class of adversaries (defined precisely
                 herein). Our perturbation algorithm guarantees privacy

  abstract =     "As advances in technology allow for the collection,
                 storage, and analysis of vast amounts of data, the task
                 of screening and assessing the significance of
                 discovered patterns is becoming a major challenge in
                 data mining applications. In this work, we address
                 significance in the context of frequent itemset mining.
                 Specifically, we develop a novel methodology to
                 identify a meaningful support threshold $s^*$ for a
                 dataset, such that the number of itemsets with support
                 at least $s^*$ represents a substantial deviation from
                 what would be expected in a random dataset with the
                 same number of transactions and the same individual
                 item frequencies. These itemsets can then be flagged as
                 statistically significant with a small false discovery
                 rate.\par

                 Our methodology hinges on a Poisson approximation to
                 the distribution of the number of itemsets in a random
                 dataset with support at least $s$, for any $s$ greater
                 than or equal to a minimum threshold $s_{\hbox{min}}$.
                 We obtain this result through a novel application of
                 the Chen-Stein approximation method, which is of
                 independent interest. Based on this approximation, we
                 develop an efficient parametric multi-hypothesis test
                 for identifying the desired threshold $s^*$. A crucial
                 feature of our approach is that, unlike most previous
                 work, it takes into account the entire dataset rather
                 than individual discoveries. It is therefore better
                 able to distinguish between significant observations
                 and random fluctuations. We present extensive
                 experimental results to substantiate the effectiveness

                 variant of classical caching in which an algorithm can
                 return an element from the cache that is similar, but
                 not necessarily identical, to the query element. We are
                 motivated by buffer management questions in approximate
                 nearest-neighbor applications, especially in the
                 context of caching targeted advertisements on the web.
                 Formally, we assume the queries lie in a metric space,
                 with distance function $d(\ldots{})$. A query $p$ is
                 considered a cache hit if there is a point $q$ in the
                 cache that is sufficiently close to $p$, i.e., for a
                 threshold radius $r$, we have $d(p,q) \leq r$. The goal
                 is then to minimize the number of cache misses,
                 vis-{\`a}-vis the optimal algorithm. As with classical
                 caching, we use the competitive ratio to measure the
                 performance of different algorithms.\par

                 While similarity caching is a strict generalization of
                 classical caching, we show that unless the algorithm is
                 allowed extra power (either in the size of the cache or
                 the threshold $r$) over the optimal offline algorithm,
                 the problem is intractable. We then proceed to quantify
                 the hardness as a function of the complexity of the
                 underlying metric space. We show that the problem
                 becomes easier as we proceed from general metric spaces
                 to those of bounded doubling dimension, and to
                 Euclidean metrics. Finally, we investigate several
                 extensions of the problem: dependence of the threshold
                 $r$ on the query and a smoother trade-off between the
                 cache-miss cost and the query-query similarity.",

                 of the streaming model, where only the most `recent'
                 elements remain active and the rest are discarded in a
                 stream. The sliding windows model is important for many
                 applications (see, e.g., Babcock, Babu, Datar, Motwani
                 and Widom (PODS 02); and Datar, Gionis, Indyk and
                 Motwani (SODA 02)). There are two equally important
                 types of the sliding windows model -- windows with
                 fixed size, (e.g., where items arrive one at a time,
                 and only the most recent $n$ items remain active for
                 some fixed parameter $n$), and bursty windows (e.g.,
                 where many items can arrive in `bursts' at a single
                 step and where only items from the last $t$ steps
                 remain active, again for some fixed parameter
                 $t$).\par

                 {\em Random sampling\/} is a fundamental tool for data
                 streams, as numerous algorithms operate on the sampled
                 data instead of on the entire stream. Effective
                 sampling from sliding windows is a nontrivial problem,
                 as elements eventually expire. In fact, the deletions
                 are {\em implicit\/}; i.e., it is not possible to
                 identify deleted elements without storing the entire
                 window. The implicit nature of deletions on sliding
                 windows does not allow the existing methods (even those
                 that support explicit deletions, e.g., Cormode,
                 Muthukrishnan and Rozenbaum (VLDB 05); Frahling, Indyk
                 and Sohler (SOCG 05)) to be directly `translated' to
                 the sliding windows model. One trivial approach to
                 overcoming the problem of implicit deletions is that of
                 over-sampling. When $k$ samples are required, the
                 over-sampling method maintains $k' > k$ samples in the
                 hope that at least $k$ samples are not expired. The
                 obvious disadvantages of this method are
                 twofold:\par

                 (a) It introduces additional costs and thus decreases
                 the performance; and\par

                 (b) The memory bounds are not deterministic, which is
                 atypical for streaming algorithms (where even small
                 probability events may eventually happen for a stream
                 that is big enough).\par

                 Babcock, Datar and Motwani (SODA 02), were the first to
                 stress the importance of improvements to over-sampling.
                 They formally introduced the problem of sampling from
                 sliding windows and improved the over-sampling method
                 for {\em sampling with replacement}. Their elegant
                 solutions for sampling with replacement are optimal
                 {\em in expectation}, and thus resolve disadvantage
                 $(a)$ mentioned above. Unfortunately, the randomized
                 bounds do not resolve disadvantage $(b)$ above.
                 Interestingly, all algorithms that employ the ideas of
                 Babcock, Datar and Motwani have the same central
                 problem of having to deal with randomized complexity
                 (see e.g., Datar and Muthukrishnan (ESA 02);
                 Chakrabarti, Cormode and McGregor (SODA 07)). Further,
                 the proposed solutions of Babcock, Datar and Motwani
                 for {\em sampling without replacement\/} are based on
                 the criticized over-sampling method and thus do not
                 solve problem $(a)$. Therefore, the question of whether
                 we can solve sampling on sliding windows optimally
                 (i.e., resolving both disadvantages) is implicit in the
                 paper of Babcock, Datar and Motwani and has remained
                 open for all variants of the problem.\par

                 In this paper we answer these questions affirmatively
                 and provide optimal sampling schemas for all variants
                 of the problem, i.e., sampling with or without
                 replacement from fixed or bursty windows. Specifically,
                 for fixed-size windows, we provide optimal solutions
                 that require $O(k)$ memory; for bursty windows, we show
                 algorithms that require $O(k \log n)$, which is optimal
                 since it matches the lower bound by Gemulla and Lehner
                 (SIGMOD 08). In contrast to the work of Babcock, Datar
                 and Motwani, our solutions have deterministic
                 bounds. Thus, we prove a perhaps somewhat surprising
                 fact: the memory complexity of the sampling-based
                 algorithm for all variants of the sliding windows model
                 is comparable with that of streaming models (i.e.,
                 without the sliding windows). This is the first result
                 of this type, since all previous `translations' of
                 sampling-based algorithms to sliding windows incur
                 randomized memory guarantees only.",

  abstract =     "The problem of finding heavy hitters and approximating
                 the frequencies of items is at the heart of many
                 problems in data stream analysis. It has been observed
                 that several proposed solutions to this problem can
                 outperform their worst-case guarantees on real data.
                 This leads to the question of whether some stronger
                 bounds can be guaranteed. We answer this in the
                 positive by showing that a class of `counter-based
                 algorithms' (including the popular and very
                 space-efficient FREQUENT and SPACESAVING algorithms)
                 provide much stronger approximation guarantees than
                 previously known. Specifically, we show that errors in
                 the approximation of individual elements do not depend
                 on the frequencies of the most frequent elements, but
                 only on the frequency of the remaining `tail.' This
                 shows that counter-based methods are the most
                 space-efficient (in fact, space-optimal) algorithms
                 having this strong error bound.\par

                 This tail guarantee allows these algorithms to solve
                 the `sparse recovery' problem. Here, the goal is to
                 recover a faithful representation of the vector of
                 frequencies, $f$. We prove that using space $O(k)$, the
                 algorithms construct an approximation $f*$ to the
                 frequency vector $f$ so that the L1 error $||f -
                 f*||_1$ is close to the best possible error
                 $\hbox{min}_{f_2} || f_2 - f ||_1$, where $f$ 2 ranges
                 over all vectors with at most $k$ non-zero entries.
                 This improves the previously best known space bound of
                 about $O(k \log n)$ for streams without element
                 deletions (where $n$ is the size of the domain from
                 which stream elements are drawn). Other consequences of
                 the tail guarantees are results for skewed (Zipfian)
                 data, and guarantees for accuracy of merging multiple
                 summarized streams.",

                 hitters and quantiles are two important statistics for
                 characterizing a data distribution. Let $A$ be a
                 multiset of elements, drawn from the universe $U =
                 \{1,\ldots{}, u\}$. For a given $0 \leq \Phi \leq 1$,
                 the $\Phi$-heavy hitters are those elements of $A$
                 whose frequency in $A$ is at least $\Phi |A|$; the

                 that at most $\Phi|A|$ elements of $A$ are smaller than
                 $A$ and at most $(1-\Phi)|A|$ elements of $A$ are

                 advances in the development of worst-case efficient
                 range search indexing structures, that is, structures
                 for storing a set of data points such that the points
                 in a axis-parallel (hyper-) query rectangle can be
                 found efficiently (with as few disk accesses - or I/Os
                 - as possible). We first quickly discuss the well-known
                 and optimal structure for the one-dimensional version
                 of the problem, the B-tree [10, 12], along with its
                 variants weight-balanced B-trees [9], multi-version (or
                 persistent) B-trees [6, 11, 13, 22] and buffer-trees
                 [4]. Then we discuss the external priority search tree
                 [8], which solves a restricted version of the
                 two-dimensional version of the problem where the query
                 rectangle is unbounded on one side. This structure is
                 then used in a range tree index structure [8, 21] that
                 answers general two-dimensional queries in the same
                 number of I/Os as the B-tree in the one-dimensional
                 case, but using super-linear space. We also describe
                 the linear space kdB-tree [19, 20] and O-tree [17]
                 index structures that also solve the problem
                 efficiently (but using more I/Os than the range tree).
                 A detailed presentation of all the above structures can
                 be found in lecture notes by the author [5].  Finally,
                 we also discuss lower bounds techniques, most notably
                 the theory of indexability [16], that can be used to
                 prove that both the range tree and kdB-tree/O-tree are
                 optimal among query efficient and linear space
                 structures, respectively [2, 8, 17], as well as recent
                 index structures for higher-dimensional range search
                 indexing [1]. We end by mentioning various R-tree
                 variant [7, 18, 15] that can be used to solve the
                 extended version of range search indexing where the
                 queries as well as the data are (hyper-) rectangles.

                 alphabet range queries of the form: Given a range

                 \alpha_r]\}$. Secondary indexes are heavily used in
                 relational databases and scientific data analysis. It
                 is well-known that the obvious solution, storing a
                 dictionary for the set $\cup_i \{\chi_i\}$ with a

                 the first theoretically optimal data structure for the
                 secondary indexing problem. In the I/O model, the

                 represent the set $I_{[\alpha_l, \alpha_r]}$, assuming
                 that the size of internal memory is $(|\sigma| \lg

                 space usage of the data structure is $O(n \lg
                 |\sigma|)$ bits in the worst case, and we further show
                 how to bound the size of the data structure in terms of
                 the $0$-th order entropy of $x$. We show how to support
                 updates achieving various time-space trade-offs.\par

                 secondary indexing problem where a query reports a

                 structure that is widely used for answering
                 one-dimensional range reporting queries. Given a set of
                 $N$ keys, a range query can be answered in $O(\log_B N
                 \over M + K \over B)$ I/Os, where $B$ is the disk block
                 size, $K$ the output size, and $M$ the size of the main
                 memory buffer. When keys are inserted or deleted, the
                 B-tree is updated in O(\log_B N)$ I/Os, if we require
                 the resulting changes to be committed to disk right
                 away. Otherwise, the memory buffer can be used to
                 buffer the recent updates, and changes can be written
                 to disk in batches, which significantly lowers the
                 amortized update cost. A systematic way of batching up
                 updates is to use the {\em logarithmic method,\/}
                 combined with {\em fractional cascading,\/} resulting
                 in a dynamic B-tree that supports insertions in $O(1
                 \over B \log N \over M)$ I/Os and queries in $O(\log N
                 \over M + K \over B)$ I/Os. Such bounds have also been
                 matched by several known dynamic B-tree variants in the
                 database literature. Note that, however, the query cost
                 of these dynamic B-trees is substantially worse than
                 the $O(\log_B N \over M + K \over B)$ bound of the
                 static B-tree by a factor of $O(\log B)$.\par

                 In this paper, we prove that for any dynamic one
                 dimensional range query index structure with query cost
                 $O(q + K \over B)$ and amortized insertion cost $O(u /
                 B)$, the tradeoff $q \cdot \log(u / q) = &\#169;(\log
                 B)$ must hold if $q = O(\log B)$. For most reasonable
                 values of the parameters, we have $N \over M =
                 B^{O(1)}$, in which case our query-insertion tradeoff
                 implies that the bounds mentioned above are already
                 optimal. We also prove a lower bound of $u \cdot \log q
                 = &\#169;(\log B)$, which is relevant for larger values
                 of $q$. Our lower bounds hold in a dynamic version of
                 the {\em indexability model}, which is of independent
                 interests. Dynamic indexability is a clean yet powerful
                 model for studying dynamic indexing problems, and can

                 select-project-join (SPJ) queries with equality
                 comparisons, also known as safe conjunctive (CQ)
                 queries, possibly with grouping and aggregation. For
                 SPJ queries, the semantics of the SQL standard treats
                 query answers as {\em multisets (bags),\/} whereas the
                 stored relations are treated either as sets, which is
                 called {\em bag-set semantics,\/} or as bags, which is
                 called {\em bag semantics}. (Under {\em set semantics},
                 both query answers and stored relations are treated as
                 sets.)\par

                 make a number of conceptual and technical
                 contributions. Specifically, we develop equivalence
                 tests for CQ queries in presence of arbitrary sets of
                 embedded dependencies under bag and bag-set semantics,
                 under the condition that chase [10] under set semantics
                 {\em (set-chase)\/} on the inputs terminates. We also

                 grouping and aggregation\/} in presence of embedded
                 dependencies. We use our equivalence tests to develop
                 sound and complete (whenever set-chase on the inputs
                 terminates) algorithms for solving instances of the
                 Query-Reformulation Problem with CQ queries under each

                 form a powerful tool for querying and maintaining
                 validity of XML documents. XML with uncertain data can
                 be modeled as a probability space of labeled trees, and
                 that space is often represented by a tree with
                 distributional nodes. This paper investigates the
                 problem of evaluating a tree automaton over such a
                 representation, where the goal is to compute the
                 probability that the automaton accepts a random
                 possible world. This problem is generally intractable,
                 but for the case where the tree automaton is
                 deterministic (and its transitions are defined by
                 deterministic string automata), an efficient algorithm
                 is presented. The paper discusses the applications of

                 are 'docking points', to which XML subtrees can be
                 attached. These subtrees may be provided and controlled
                 by peers at remote locations, or may correspond to the
                 result of function calls, e.g., Web services. If a
                 global type $\tau$, e.g. a DTD, is specified for a
                 distributed document $T$, it would be most desirable to
                 be able to break this type into a collection of local

                 contribution is a polynomial-space algorithm for

                 Clustering is one of the key problems in this

                 clustering, specifically the {\em k\/} -center problem.
                 Since the problem is NP-Hard in deterministic setting,

                 However, the key aspect of this paper is to devise
                 general techniques for optimization under uncertainty.
                 We show that a particular formulation which uses the
                 contribution of a random variable above its expectation
                 is useful in this context. We believe these techniques

                 probabilistic skylines. The previous work requires

                 relies on the assumption that points with skyline
