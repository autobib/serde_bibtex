 abstract  = {The analysis of natural language in the context of keyboard-driven dialogue
	     systems is the central issue addressed in this paper. A module that corrects typing
	     errors, performs domain-specific morphological analysis is developed. A parser for
	     typed unification grammars is designed and implemented in C++; for description of
	     the lexicon and the grammer a specialised specification language is developed. It
	     is argued that typed unification grammars and especially the newly developed
	     specification language are convenient formalisms for describing natural language
	     use in dialogue systems. Research on these issues is carried out in the context of
	     the Schisma project, a research project in linguistic engineering; participants in
	     Schisma are KPN Research and the University of Twente.},
