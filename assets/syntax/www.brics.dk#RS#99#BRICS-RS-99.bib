                  A proposal has recently been made for a modular

                  other papers for a full introduction. This
                  paper focusses on illustrating the
                  applicability of Modular SOS, by using it to
                  give a description of a sublanguage of

                  comparing the MSOS description with previous

                  Action Notation. Due to its modularity, the
                  MSOS description pin-points some complications
                  in the design of Action Notation, and should
                  facilitate the design of an improved version of
                  the notation. It also provides a major example

                  its basic properties. In particular, we provide

                  distributed automata called bounded

                  The previous results on derandomizing {\rm\bf

                  contrast, our approach is based on a
                  strengthening of Andreev, Clementi and Rolim's
                  hitting set approach to derandomization. As a
                  spin-off, we show that this approach is strong
                  enough to give an easy (if the existence of

                  control-flow analysis. We designed and
                  implemented a dedicated partial evaluator, able
                  to specialize the analysis wrt.\ a given
                  constraint graph and thus remove the
                  interpretive overhead, and measured it with
                  Feeley's Scheme benchmarks. Even though the

                  $G$ means deleting $su,sv$ and adding a new
                  edge $uv$. Let $G=(V+s,E)$ be
                  $k$-edge-connected in $V$ ($k\geq 2$) and let
                  $d(s)$ be even. Lov{\'a}sz proved that the
                  edges incident to $s$ can be split off in pairs
                  in a such a way that the resulting graph on
                  vertex set $V$ is $k$-edge-connected. In this
                  paper we investigate the existence of such
                  complete splitting sequences when the set of
                  split edges has to meet additional
                  requirements. We prove structural properties of
                  the set of those pairs $u,v$ of neighbours of
                  $s$ for which splitting off $su,sv$ destroys
                  $k$-edge-connectivity. This leads to a new
                  method for solving problems of this
                  type.\bibpar
                  
                  By applying this method we obtain a short proof
                  for a recent result of Nagamochi and Eades on
                  planarity-preserving complete splitting
                  sequences and prove the following new results:
                  let $G$ and $H$ be two graphs on the same set
                  $V+s$ of vertices and suppose that their sets
                  of edges incident to $s$ coincide. Let $G$
                  ($H$) be $k$-edge-connected
                  ($l$-edge-connected, respectively) in $V$ and
                  let $d(s)$ be even. Then there exists a pair
                  $su,sv$ which can be split off in both graphs
                  preserving $k$-edge-connectivity
                  ($l$-edge-connectivity, resp.) in $V$, provided
                  $d(s)\geq 6$. If $k$ and $l$ are both even then
                  such a pair always exists. Using these
                  edge-splitting results and the polymatroid
                  intersection theorem we give a polynomial
                  algorithm for the problem of simultaneously
                  augmenting the edge-connectivity of two graphs
                  by adding a (common) set of new edges of

                  principles which generalize (and for $n=0$

                  lemma WKL (which has been studied extensively
                  in the context of second order arithmetic) to
                  logically more complex tree predicates. Whereas
                  the second order context used in the program of
                  reverse mathematics requires an encoding of
                  higher analytical concepts like continuous
                  functions $F:X\rightarrow Y$ between Polish
                  spaces $X,Y$, the more flexible language of our
                  systems allows to treat such objects directly.
                  This is of relevance as the encoding of $F$
                  used in reverse mathematics tacitly yields a
                  constructively enriched notion of continuous
                  functions which e.g. for $F:{\mathord{\rm
                  I\mkern-3.1mu N}}^{{\mathord{\rm I\mkern-3.1mu
                  N}}}\rightarrow{\mathord{\rm I\mkern-3.1mu N}}$
                  can be seen (in our higher order context) to be
                  equivalent to the existence of a continuous
                  modulus of pointwise continuity. For the direct
                  representation of $F$ the existence of such a
                  modulus is independent even of full arithmetic
                  in all finite types E-PA$^{\omega}$ plus
                  quantifier-free choice, as we show using a
                  priority construction due to L. Harrington. The
                  usual WKL-based proofs of properties of $F$
                  given in reverse mathematics make use of the
                  enrichment provided by codes of $F$, and WKL
                  does not seem to be sufficient to obtain
                  similar results for the direct representation
                  of $F$ in our setting. However, it turns out

                  equations. We present the symmetric
                  transformation: lambda-dropping.
                  Lambda-dropping a set of recursive equations
                  restores block structure and lexical
                  scope.\bibpar
                  
                  For lack of block structure and lexical scope,
                  recursive equations must carry around all the
                  parameters that any of their callees might
                  possibly need. Both lambda-lifting and
                  lambda-dropping thus require one to compute
                  Def/Use paths: 
                  \begin{itemize}
                  \item for lambda-lifting: each of the functions
                    occurring in the path of a free variable is
                    passed this variable as a parameter;
                  
                  \item for lambda-dropping: parameters which are
                    used in the same scope as their definition do
                    not need to be passed along in their path. 
                  \end{itemize}
                  
                  A program whose blocks have no free variables
                  is scope-insensitive. Its blocks are then free
                  to float (for lambda-lifting) or to sink (for
                  lambda-dropping) along the vertices of the
                  scope tree. \bibpar
                  
                  Our primary application is partial evaluation.
                  Indeed, many partial evaluators for procedural
                  programs operate on recursive equations. To
                  this end, they lambda-lift source programs in a
                  pre-processing phase. But often, partial
                  evaluators [automatically] produce residual
                  recursive equations with dozens of parameters,
                  which most compilers do not handle efficiently.
                  We solve this critical problem by
                  lambda-dropping residual programs in a
                  post-processing phase, which significantly
                  improves both their compile time and their run
                  time. \bibpar
                  
                  Lambda-lifting has been presented as an
                  intermediate transformation in compilers for
                  functional languages. We study lambda-lifting
                  and lambda-dropping per se, though
                  lambda-dropping also has a use as an
                  intermediate transformation in a compiler: we
                  noticed that lambda-drop\-ping a program
                  corresponds to transforming it into the
                  functional representation of its optimal SSA
                  form. This observation actually led us to
                  substantially improve our PEPM~'97 presentation
                  of lambda-dropping",

                  interpreted over Mazurkiewicz traces which
                  allows quantification over causal chains.
                  Through this device one can directly formulate

                  strengthening the chain quantification

                  presented. It extends previous work on
                  bisimulation from open maps and answers a
                  fundamental question there. The consequences of
                  the general theory are derived for two key
                  models for concurrency, the interleaving model
                  of synchronisation trees and the independence
                  model of labelled event structures. Starting
                  with a ``hiding'' functor from a category of
                  paths to observable paths, it is shown how to
                  derive a monad on the category of presheaves
                  over the category of paths. The Kleisli
                  category of the monad is shown to be equivalent
                  to that of presheaves with weak morphisms,
                  which roughly are only required to preserve
                  observable paths. The monad is defined through
                  an intermediary view of processes as bundles in
                  {\bf Cat}. This view, which seems important in
                  its own right, leads directly to a hiding
                  operation on processes; when the hiding
                  operation is translated back to presheaves
                  through an adjunction it yields the monad. The
                  monad is shown to automatically preserve
                  open-map bisimulation, generalising the
                  expectation that strongly bisimilar processes
                  should be weakly bisimilar. However, two
                  alternative general ways to define weak
                  bisimulation and observation congruence (in the
                  Kleisli category itself or in the presheaf
                  category after application of the monad) do not
                  coincide in general. However a necessary and
                  sufficient condition for their equivalence is
                  proved; from this it is sufficient to show a
                  fill-in condition applies to category of paths
                  with weak morphisms. The fill-in condition is
                  shown to hold for the two traditional models,

                  extended to the left and right without making

                  for finding all maximal pairs under various

                  representing function $f$). Based on this
                  principle one can formulate subsystems of
                  higher-order arithmetic which allow to carry
                  out very substantial parts of classical
                  mathematics but are $\Pi^0_2$-conservative over
                  primitive recursive arithmetic PRA (and even
                  weaker fragments of arithmetic). In 1992 we
                  established such conservation results relative
                  to finite type extensions PRA$^{\omega}$ of PRA
                  (together with a quantifier-free axiom of
                  choice schema). In this setting one can
                  consider also a uniform version UWKL of WKL
                  which asserts the existence of a functional
                  $\Phi$ which selects uniformly in a given
                  infinite binary tree $f$ an infinite path $\Phi
                  f$ of that tree. This uniform version of WKL is
                  of interest in the context of explicit
                  mathematics as developed by S. Feferman. The
                  elimination process from 1992 actually can be
                  used to eliminate even this uniform weak

                  In this paper we show that in the presence of
                  $(E)$, UWKL is much stronger than WKL: whereas

                  audio/video components is modeled and verified
                  using the real-time model checker {\sc Uppaal}.
                  The system is supposed to reside in an
                  audio/video component and control (read from
                  and write to) links to neighbor audio/video
                  components such as TV, VCR and remote--control.
                  In particular, the system is responsible for
                  the powering up and down of the component in
                  between the arrival of data, and in order to do
                  so in a safe way without loss of data, it is
                  essential that no link interrupts are lost.
                  Hence, a component system is a multitasking
                  system with hard real-time requirements, and we
                  present techniques for modeling time
                  consumption in such a multitasked, prioritized
                  system. The work has been carried out in a
                  collaboration between Aalborg University and
                  the audio/video company B\&O. By modeling the
                  system, 3 design errors were identified and
                  corrected, and the following verification
                  confirmed the validity of the design but also
                  revealed the necessity for an upper limit of
                  the interrupt frequency. The resulting design
                  has been implemented and it is going to be
                  incorporated as part of a new product line",

                  characterise the difference between the two
                  bisimulations in {\em trace-theoretical} terms,
                  advocating the view that the first is (just) a
                  bisimulation for {\em causality}, while the
                  second is a bisimulation for {\em concurrency}.
                  We explore the frontier zone between the two
                  notions by defining a {\em hierarchy} of
                  bounded backtracking bisimulations. Our goal is
                  to provide a stepping stone for the solution to
                  the intriguing open problem of whether
                  hereditary history-preserving bisimulation is

                  rules out the possibility that decidability of
                  the general problem follows directly from the
                  special case. Finally, we give a non trivial
