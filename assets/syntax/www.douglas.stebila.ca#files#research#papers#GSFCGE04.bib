	Abstract = {Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is emerging as an attractive alternative to traditional public-key 
cryptosystems (RSA, DSA, DH). ECC offers equivalent security with smaller key sizes resulting in faster 
computations, lower power consumption, as well as memory and bandwidth savings. While these char- 
acteristics make ECC especially appealing for mobile devices, they can also alleviate the computational 
burden on secure web servers. 

This article studies the performance impact of using ECC with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the 
dominant Internet security protocol. We benchmark the Apache web server with an ECC-enhanced 
version of OpenSSL under a variety of conditions. Our results show that an Apache web server can 
handle 11\%-31\% more HTTPS requests per second when using ECC rather than RSA at short-term 
security levels. At security levels necessary to protect data beyond 2010, the use of ECC over RSA 
improves server performance by 110\%-279\% under realistic workloads.},
