  abstract = {Reliable, fast and deterministic transmission of control information
	in a network is a need for many distributed systems. One example
	is timing systems, where a reference frequency is used to accurately
	schedule time-critical messages. The White Rabbit (WR) project is
	a multi-laboratory and multi-company effort to bring together the
	best of the data transfer and timing worlds in a completely open
	design. It takes advantage of the latest developments for improving
	timing over Ethernet, such as IEEE 1588 (Precision Time Protocol)
	and Synchronous Ethernet. The presented approach aims for a general
	purpose, fieldbus-like transmission system, which provides deterministic
	data and timing (sub-ns accuracy and ps jitter) to around 1000 stations.
	It automatically compensates for fiber lengths in the order of 10
	km. This paper describes the WR design goals and the specification
	used for the project. It goes on to describe the central component
	of the WR system structure - the WR switch - with theoretical considerations
	about the requirements. Finally, it presents real timing measurements
	for the first prototypes of WR hardware.},
