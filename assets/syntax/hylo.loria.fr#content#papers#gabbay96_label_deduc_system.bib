  abstract = {
	Labelled deductive systems (LDSs) form a general framework, proposed
	by the author of this book, to treat a great variety of logical systems.
	Labels are used in order to describe structures richer than sets of
	formulas, making it possible to manipulate information, databases,
	etc. The notion of deduction is considered from the viewpoint of
	a pruned (monotonicity is rejected) variant of Tarski's consequence
	relation. The author says this notion was put forward in A. Tarski's
	paper "On the concept of logical consequence" [Actualites Sci. Indust.
	394 (1936), 1--11; JFM 62.1050.05], but that paper is a presentation
	of the semantical notion of consequence and does not present an axiomatization
	of this notion, which Tarski had given earlier [Ann. Polon. Math.
	7 (1928), 270--272; JFM 55.0038.15].
	The bibliography also lacks several other basic references [e.g.,
	R. Wojcicki, Theory of logical calculi, Kluwer Acad. Publ., Dordrecht],
	and serious misprints appear in the references to A. Rose's papers.
	The book presents the formal machinery of LDSs: proof theory, semantics,
	and algebraic LDSs, with many examples: modal and tense logics, fuzzy
	and many-valued logics, linear and relevant logics, nonmonotonic
	logic, etc. (some important nonclassical logics such as paraconsistent
	logic are not taken into account). No genuinely new results about
	these logics are presented, nor are their philosophical foundations
	discussed.
	These criticisms notwithstanding, this book will be of great interest
	for anyone who wants to grasp, together with a number of formal techniques,
	a multiplicity of logical systems, mostly related to computer science
	and artificial intelligence.
	(The first chapter, entitled "What is a logical system?", has also
	appeared elsewhere [in What is a logical system?, 179--216, Oxford
	Univ. Press, New York, 1994].) }
