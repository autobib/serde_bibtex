	abstract = {Portable devices come with different individual limitations in user interaction like limited display size, small keyboard and
different sorts of input and output channels. With the advancement of speech recognition and speech synthesis technologies,
their optionals or alternatives become feasible and attractive for mobile devices in order to implement real multimodal
user interaction. However, current systems and formats do not sufficiently integrate advanced multimodal interaction. We
introduce an advanced system for Multimodal Interaction and Rendering (MIRS) dedicated for mobile devices. The MIRS
system incorporates efficient processing of XML specification languages for limited, mobile devices. It comes with the XMLbased
Dialog and Interface Specification Language (DISL). DISL can be considered as an UIML subset, which is enhanced by
the means of state-oriented dialog specification. That dialog specification is based on DSN (Dialog Specification Notation), which was introduced to describe the Control Model of a User Interface as a cross product of several interaction states
together with transition rules forming new cross products.},
