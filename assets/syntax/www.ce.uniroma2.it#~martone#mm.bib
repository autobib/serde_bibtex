  abstract = {In our earlier work, we have investigated on the feasibility of utilization of recursive partitioning in sparse matrix computations on multi-core cache based computers. After having assessed its effectiveness in matrix-vector multiplication in \cite{synasc10-p}, here we discuss how the use of this storage format can be tuned by limiting the bandwidth overhead by the usage of 16 bit indices in leaf submatrices (at the end of the recursion). Experimental results obtained on a collection of matrices and on 8-core machines illustrate effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Recently, we have introduced an approach to multi-core computations on sparse matrices using recursive partitioning, called {Recursive Sparse Blocks} ({RSB}). In this document, we discuss issues involved in assembling matrices in the {RSB} format. Since the main expected application area is iterative methods, we compare the performance of matrix assembly to that of matrix-vector multiply ({SPMV}), outlining both scalability of the method and execution times ratio.},

Here, the memory representation of a sparse matrix consists of a set of submatrices, which are used as leaves of a quad-tree structure. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact, on the Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication ({SPMV}), of a modification to our {Recursive CSR} implementation, allowing the use of multiple data structures in leaf matrices ({CSR/COO}, with either 16/32 bit indices).},

In this note we propose a recursive storage format for sparse matrices, and evaluate its usage for the {Sparse Matrix-Vector (SpMV)} operation on two multicore and one multiprocessor machines. We report benchmark results showing high performance and scalability comparable to current state of the art implementations.},
