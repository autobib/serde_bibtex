  abstract = {In this thesis, we describe and validate a statistical breathing motion
	model for respiratory motion compensation during image-guided cardiac
	interventions such as Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) for
	Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO). In a preparatory training phase,
	a preoperative 3-D segmentation of the coronary arteries is automatically
	registered with a cardiacgated biplane cineangiogram at different
	breathing phases, and used to build the subject-specific motion model.
	The trained model mathematically describes the nature of respiratory-induced
	motion of the heart and is used as prior knowledge for the intraoperative
	re-registrations of the 3-D roadmap by restricting the search space
	to the most dominant modes of the motion profile. In this way, the
	interventionalist is provided visual guiding assistance during cardiac
	catheterization procedures under live fluoroscopy. The model-constrained
	registration increases the robustness and accuracy of the dynamic
	re-registrations, especially for weak data constraints such as low
	signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the lack of contrast information in
	fluoroscopic images, or an intraoperative monoplane setting. This
	allows for reducing radiation dose without compromising on registration
	accuracy. Synthetic data as well as phantom and clinical data sets
	have been used to validate the model-based registration in terms
	of accuracy, robustness and speed. We were able to significantly
	accelerate the intraoperative registration with an average 3-D error
	of less than 2mm even for monoplane settings and tracked guidewire
	data in the absence of contrast agent, which makes respiratory motion
	correction feasible during clinical procedures. Moreover, we propose
	a new methodology for global vessel segmentation in 2-D X-ray images
	combining a per-pixel probability map from a local vessel enhancement
	filter with local directional information. The global segmentation
	provides additional connectivity and geometric shape information,
	which allows for sophisticated postprocessing techniques in order
	to refine the segmentation with respect to the requirements of the
	particular application. We present different postprocessing techniques
	for hierarchical segmentation, centerline extraction, and catheter
	removal. We further demonstrate that the global segmentation approach
	yields better segmentation results and is more robust to noise compared
	to two conventional local Hessian-based segmentation approaches.},
