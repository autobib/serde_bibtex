   Abstract = {Abstract. This paper examines the positioning accuracy of a GSM beaconbased
location system in a metropolitan environment. We explore five factors
effecting positioning accuracy: location algorithm choice, scan set size,
simultaneous use of cells from different providers, training and testing on
different devices, and calibration data density. We collected a 208-hour,
4350Km driving trace of three different GSM networks covering the Seattle
metropolitan area. We show a median error of 94m in downtown and 196m in
residential areas using a single GSM network and the best algorithm for each
area. Estimating location using multiple providers’ cells reduces median error to
65-134 meters and 95% error to 163m in the downtown area, which meets the
accuracy requirements for E911. We also show that a small 60-hour calibration
drive is sufficient for enabling a metropolitan area similar to Seattle.},

   Abstract = {Location-enhanced mobile devices are becoming common,
but applications built for these devices find themselves suffering a mismatch
between the latitude and longitude that location sensors provide
and the colloquial place label that applications need. Conveying my location
to my spouse, for example as (48.13641N, 11.57471E), is less informative
than saying “at home.”We introduce an algorithm called Beacon-
Print that uses WiFi and GSM radio fingerprints collected by someone’s
personal mobile device to automatically learn the places they go and
then detect when they return to those places. BeaconPrint does not automatically
assign names or semantics to places. Rather, it provides the
technological foundation to support this task. We compare BeaconPrint
to three existing algorithms using month-long trace logs from each of
three people. Algorithmic results are supplemented with a survey study
about the places people go. BeaconPrint is over 90% accurate in learning
and recognizing places. Additionally, it improves accuracy in recognizing
places visited infrequently or for short durations—a category where
previous approaches have fared poorly. BeaconPrint demonstrates 63%
accuracy for places someone returns to only once or visits for less than
10 minutes, increasing to 80% accuracy for places visited twice.},
