	to numerous types of data, including telephone records, Web documents,

	the data in a single pass, or a small number of passes, while using
	little memory, is crucial. We describe such a streaming algorithm
	that effectively clusters large data streams. We also provide empirical
	evidence of the algorithm's performance on synthetic and real data
	streams.},
