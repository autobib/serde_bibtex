   ,Abstract="
      Information seeking skills are becoming increasingly important as
      rapid and widespread developments in technology have made information
      available in more formats and from more sources than ever
      before. Research in human computer interaction (HCI) has demonstrated
      that primary cognitive abilities represent a powerful predictor of
      information-seeking success in electronic information
      systems. Specifically, spatial visualization ability (SVA) seems to
      be particularly related to hierarchical menus systems navigation
      within databases, online learning environments, information archival
      systems, and virtually all internet web sites. Research indicates
      that individuals with low SVA take longer to complete tasks and
      experience more errors on first attempts to find information in
      hierarchical databases compared to those with high SVA. Understanding
      the influences of SVA as well as its interaction with other aspects
      of individual differences, such as domain expertise, is critical to
      the design of systems intended to accommodate individual differences
      in users.

      Thirty-five college students (23 males and 12 females) were selected
      from the general student body of two universities and assigned to
      groups based upon their self-reported membership in one of two
      specific disciplines: business (n=26) or biology (n=9). Participants
      were then assigned to groups based upon scores on tests of SVA using
      a median-split. Each participant conducted five searches: one neutral
      search, two searches for business related information, and two
      searches for biology related information using the FirstSearch
      archival search tool.

      A $2 \times $2 factorial Analysis of Variance with one between-groups
      variable (high vs. low SVA) and one within-group variable (high
      vs. low domain expertise) indicated a significant main effect of SVA
      as well as a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on the time
      required to find their first relevant article on the search
      topic. The analysis also revealed that there was no main effect for
      SVA on the total number of relevant articles found during the search
      period but there was a significant main effect of Domain Expertise on
      the total total-number-of-relevant-articles found. There was no
      interaction between SVA and Domain Expertise on either time to first
      article or total number of articles found.

      Results of the study extend existing knowledge regarding the effects
      of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking by demonstrating a
      strong effect of SVA and domain expertise on information seeking
      skills. The results of this study also provide evidence in support of
      interface designs that are friendlier to information seekers who have
      low SVA. Related findings and suggestions for further research are
      discussed."
