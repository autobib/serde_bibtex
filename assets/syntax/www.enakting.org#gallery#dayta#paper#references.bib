It presents an evaluation of an initial prototype, showing that Clustered TDB offers excellent scaling characteristics with respect to load times and query throughput. Design decisions are justified in the context of a literature review on Database Management System (DBMS) and RDF store clustering, and it is shown that many techniques created during the course of DBMS research are applicable to the problem of storing RDF data.

Abstract = {We address the problem of scalable distributed reasoning, proposing a technique for materialising the closure of an RDF graph based on MapReduce. We have implemented our approach on top of Hadoop and deployed it on a compute cluster of up to 64 commodity machines. We show that a naive implementation on top of MapReduce is straightforward but performs badly and we present several non-trivial optimisations. Our algorithm is scalable and allows us to compute the RDFS closure of 865M triples from the Web (producing 30B triples) in less than two hours, faster than any other published approach.},
