                 iteration schemes based on Krylov subspace projection
                 methods for solving nonlinear equations. The simplest
                 such class of methods is Newton's algorithm in which a
                 (linear) Krylov method is used to solve the Jacobian
                 system approximately. A method in this class is
                 referred to as a Newton--Krylov algorithm. To improve
                 the global convergence properties of these basic
                 algorithms, we will propose hybrid methods based on
                 Powell's Dogleg strategy, as well as linesearch
                 backtracking procedures. The main advantage of the
                 class of methods considered in this paper is that the
                 Jacobian matrix is never needed explicitly.",

                 linear parabolic problems. The first of these methods
                 is based on using polynomial approximation to the
                 exponential. It does not require solving any linear
                 systems and is highly parallelizable. The two other
                 methods proposed are based on Pade and Chebyshev
                 approximations to the matrix exponential. The
                 parallelization of these methods is achieved by using
                 partial fraction decomposition techniques to solve the
                 resulting systems and thus offers the potential for
                 increased time parallelism in time dependent problems.
                 We also present experimental results from the Alliant

                 differential equations leads to linear systems with
                 special block tridiagonal matrices. Several methods are
                 known to solve these systems, the most general of which
                 is the Block Cyclic Reduction (BCR) algorithm which
                 handles equations with nonconstant coefficients. A
                 method was recently proposed to parallelize and
                 vectorize BCR. In this paper we discuss the mapping of
                 BCR on distributed memory architectures and compare its
                 complexity with that of other approaches including the
                 Alternating-Direction method. We also describe a fast
                 parallel solver, based on an explicit formula for the
                 solution, which has parallel computational complexity
                 lower than that of parallel BCR.",

                 techniques for solving parabolic equations by the
                 method of lines. The main motivation for the proposed
                 approach is the possibility to exploit a high degree of
                 parallelism in a simple manner. The basic idea of the
                 method is to approximate the action of the evolution
                 operator on a given state vector by means of a
                 projection process onto a Krylov subspace. Thus, the
                 resulting approximation consists of applying an
                 evolution operator of very small dimension to a known
                 vector. This is in turn computed accurately by
                 exploiting well-known rational approximations to the
                 exponential. Since the rational approximation is only
                 applied to a small matrix, the only operations required
                 with the original large matrix are matrix by vector
                 products, and as a result the algorithm can easily by
                 parallelized and vectorized. Some relevant
                 approximation and stability issues are discussed. We
                 present numerical experiments with the method on a Cray
                 Y-MP and compare its performance with a few explicit
                 and implicit algorithms.",

  abstract =     "The power of density functional theory is often
                 limited by the high computational demand in solving an
                 eigenvalue problem at each self-consistent-field (SCF)
                 iteration. The method presented in this paper replaces
                 the explicit eigenvalue calculations by an
                 approximation of the wanted invariant subspace,
                 obtained with the help of well-selected Chebyshev
                 polynomial filters. In this approach, only the initial
                 SCF iteration requires solving an eigenvalue problem,
                 in order to provide a good initial subspace. In the
                 remaining SCF iterations, no iterative eigensolvers are
                 involved. Instead, Chebyshev polynomials are used to
                 refine the subspace. The subspace iteration at each
                 step is easily five to ten times faster than solving a
                 corresponding eigenproblem by the most efficient
                 eigen-algorithms. Moreover, the subspace iteration
                 reaches self-consistency within roughly the same number
                 of steps as an eigensolver-based approach. This results
                 in a significantly faster SCF iteration.",
